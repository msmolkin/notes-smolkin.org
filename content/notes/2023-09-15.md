googled `Error: It seems there is already a Binary at '/usr/local/bin/editcap'.`
top hit: https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/discussions/171
skimmed it.		explanation you can skip: saw the word "conflicts," that it conflicts with wireshark. remembered that I initially ran `brew install wireshark` successfully, and then they suggested that I run `brew install --cask wireshark` and it worked. And in the message on the CLI that told me to install the cask,
```
This formula only installs the command-line utilities by default.
Install Wireshark.app with Homebrew Cask:
brew install --cask wireshark
```
, it said that the previous command installed part of the same thing. figured out that the problem is probably in the conflict. After all, if they're the same thing, and the issue was that some file is already there, then, probably that file was installed by the previous one.
ran `brew remove wireshark` followed by `brew install --cask wireshark`
fixed.

side note: if you install wireshark with homebrew, save yourself one step:
don't `run brew install --cask wireshark-chmodbpf` afterwards.
`Error: Cask 'wireshark-chmodbpf' conflicts with 'wireshark'.`
I think this is in case you just wanted the command-line interface (`brew install wireshark`) and the capture interfaces are therefore not installed.
