It keeps amazing me how much we can do. Ideally, if I had unlimited money, I wouldn't have to even do this and think about it, but then I wouldn't be impressed. I gave it such a simple command, without formatting it and even without saying please. wasted an extra few input characters. boom. took me two tries to get it right.

And the problem was probably on my end, because I *did* ask for one character, and the comment syntax requires two characters.
