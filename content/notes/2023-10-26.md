So it's actually twice as expensive to launch a t2.micro instance (1.4¢/hr) as it is to launch a t2.nano instance (.7¢/hr). That's not that unpredictable. But what is more surprising: And it's almost two times *more* expensive to launch an older, gen 1 processor: t1.micro costs 2.5¢/hr. Since I run my ec2 instance 24/7 (yes, I know I can turn it off when all bots go to sleep and turn it back on when they're supposed to wake up—but my costs don't quite justify this yet), dropping down from the t2.micro that they recommended initially to t2.nano will save me nearly 50% of my monthly cost.
