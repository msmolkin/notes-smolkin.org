Three phones, I'm finally looking to upgrade my XS. Which do I take?
### iPhone benefits:
Swipe down and immediately start searching
Videos are amazing. The camera quality is… mwah.
Mute button… How do the others not have this? Did Apple patent it?
Better waterproofing, although they're all fine
Brighter
Faster than Pixel
Battery better than Samsung by a bit
### Pixel 8 Pro
Google Assistant's AI has really good voice generation. And, if I can hack it right, I might even be able to read books with it. Cha-ching.
Comes with a watch, knocking the price down by $100 by default if I were to decide to firesale it
### Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
Best photos
Apple… still made it so it doesn't connect well to the Mac. So if you didn't have this issue, then [the switch would be definitely worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niuuSCH453k)
It's the best in terms of quality

But they're all really big. I'd prefer a phone the size of the Pixel 8/15 Pro, but I just can't find a speed test that compares the 15 Pro and the Pixel 8 Pro, so I had to use the 15 Pro Max instead.

Garmin vivoactive 4S (yes, this is 4 instead of 3) is $165 [sold by BuyDig on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/333824387351)
