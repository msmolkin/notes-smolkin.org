Unpopular opinion: I, too, was a useful idiot earlier. When it came to the lockdowns, I was brainwashed just like everyone else. Most people don't want to admit it, or are afraid to think of themselves as having been so dumb. Ironically, the people who are most likely to not have been influenced by this are the ones who believe in religion and believe in God, so they also have a faith system in place.* So "everyone" (i.e. both those who espoused lockdowns and those who didn't) believes in something that they don't understand.

\* And the ones at the upper echelons of academia, who were espousing it but not believing/following it themselves. This system of "classless" society with only two classes (the one everyone knows and the one at the top controlling the masses) is very reminiscent of socialism.
