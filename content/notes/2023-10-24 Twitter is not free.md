So much for free speech. Twitter has suspended @Sci_Hub.
So [this link](https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub/status/843546352219017218), which I had bookmarked as "list of sci-hub dois" no longer works. It was also blocked in February 2023.
But it worked [back in 2019](http://web.archive.org/web/20190215083532/https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub/status/843546352219017218)
That's the power of web.archive.org/*/{insert_url_here}.
