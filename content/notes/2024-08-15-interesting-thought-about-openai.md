I just pulled up this list of models that are available from OpenAI's API for my account.

I wonder why embedding-ada-002 is owned by 'openai-internal' instead of being owned by 'system' like everything else. And why the first major released models (e.g. gpt-4-0613, before they decided to make it way dumber) are owned by 'openai'.

Maybe it's because they were created before some major changes in their internal model ownership, and they were never updated. Makes you wonder what other models are out there that are owned by 'openai-internal', like maybe that Q* model that was rumored to exist but never released (yet).
