It was supposed to create a webapp based on a war file.

Here are all the events from the environment, which was then terminated without even creating an instance:

INFO

createEnvironment is starting.

The error message Environment must have instance profile associated with it. indicates that the Elastic Beanstalk environment could not be created because there is no IAM instance profile associated with it. An IAM instance profile is required for the EC2 instances in your Elastic Beanstalk environment to have the necessary permissions to interact with other AWS services.

To resolve this issue, you need to create an IAM instance profile and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment. Here are the steps to do that:
Step 1: Create an IAM Role

    Go to the IAM Console:
        Navigate to the IAM Console.

    Create a New Role:
        Click on Roles in the left-hand menu.
        Click the Create role button.

    Select Trusted Entity:
        Choose AWS service.
        Select Elastic Beanstalk as the service that will use this role.
        Choose Elastic Beanstalk, and then click Next: Permissions.

    Attach Policies:
        Attach the necessary policies. For example, you might attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier, AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker, or AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier policies depending on your use case.
        Click Next: Tags (optional).
        Click Next: Review.

    Create Role:
        Give the role a name, for example, EBInstanceRole.
        Click Create role.

Step 2: Associate the IAM Role with the Elastic Beanstalk Environment

    Update the env-config.json file:
        Add the IamInstanceProfile option setting to your env-config.json file. For example:

        [
          {
            "Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
            "OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
            "Value": "EBInstanceRole"
          }
        ]

    Re-run the create-environment Command:
        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file.

Example Command

aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \
    --application-name url-cleaner \
    --environment-name staging \
    --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21" \
    --option-settings file://env-config.json \
    --version-label v0.0.1 \
    --profile myprofile

Step 3: Verify the Environment

    Check the Environment Status:
        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.
        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.

By following these steps, you should be able to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment with the necessary IAM instance profile, which will allow the EC2 instances to have the required permissions.

Can this IAM role be created via the CLI?

Yes, you can create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI. Below are the steps to do this:
Step 1: Create the IAM Role

    Create the Trust Policy Document:
        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }

Create the IAM Role:

    Run the following command to create the IAM role:

        aws iam create-role \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json

Step 2: Attach the Necessary Policies to the Role

    Attach Policies:
        Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier policy (or another relevant policy) to the role:

        aws iam attach-role-policy \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier

Step 3: Create the Instance Profile

    Create the Instance Profile:
        Run the following command to create the instance profile:

    aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile

Add the Role to the Instance Profile:

    Run the following command to add the role to the instance profile:

        aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \
          --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole

Step 4: Update the env-config.json File

    Update the env-config.json File:
        Add the IamInstanceProfile option setting to your env-config.json file:

        [
          {
            "Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
            "OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
            "Value": "EBInstanceProfile"
          }
        ]

Step 5: Re-run the create-environment Command

    Re-run the Command:
        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file:

        aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \
          --application-name url-cleaner \
          --environment-name staging \
          --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21" \
          --option-settings file://env-config.json \
          --version-label v0.0.1 \
          --profile myprofile

Step 6: Verify the Environment

    Check the Environment Status:
        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.
        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.

By following these steps, you should be able to create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI.

    when creating the role (first command), I get the following error: An error occurred (MalformedPolicyDocument) when calling the CreateRole operation: This policy contains invalid Json
    do I need to include --profile myprofile to ensure it uses the correct AWS account?

Let's address both issues:
1. Fixing the Malformed Policy Document Error

The error suggests that the JSON document for the trust policy might be malformed. Make sure the JSON content is correctly formatted. Here is the correct JSON content for the trust policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

Save this content as trust_policy.json. Ensure there are no extra characters or formatting issues.
2. Including the Profile in CLI Commands

Yes, you should include --profile myprofile to ensure that the commands are run using the correct AWS account profile.
Complete Steps with Profiles

Below are the complete steps with the profile included:
Step 1: Create the IAM Role

    Create the Trust Policy Document:
        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }

Create the IAM Role:

    Run the following command to create the IAM role:

        aws iam create-role \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \
          --profile myprofile

Step 2: Attach the Necessary Policies to the Role

    Attach Policies:
        Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier policy (or another relevant policy) to the role:

        aws iam attach-role-policy \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \
          --profile myprofile

Step 3: Create the Instance Profile

    Create the Instance Profile:
        Run the following command to create the instance profile:

    aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \
      --profile myprofile

Add the Role to the Instance Profile:

    Run the following command to add the role to the instance profile:

        aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \
          --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --profile myprofile

Step 4: Update the env-config.json File

    Update the env-config.json File:
        Add the IamInstanceProfile option setting to your env-config.json file:

        [
          {
            "Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
            "OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
            "Value": "EBInstanceProfile"
          }
        ]

Step 5: Re-run the create-environment Command

    Re-run the Command:
        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file:

        aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \
          --application-name url-cleaner \
          --environment-name staging \
          --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21" \
          --option-settings file://env-config.json \
          --version-label v0.0.1 \
          --profile myprofile

Step 6: Verify the Environment

    Check the Environment Status:
        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.
        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.

By following these steps, you should be able to create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI, ensuring the correct AWS account profile is used.

Error parsing parameter '--assume-role-policy-document': Unable to load paramfile file://trust_policy.json: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'trust_policy.json'

Is there a way to pass trust_policy.json's relative path?

Yes, you can pass the relative path of the trust_policy.json file. Ensure that the file is located in the correct directory relative to where you are running the command.

Here are the detailed steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:

    Create the Trust Policy Document:
        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json in your current working directory:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }

Verify the File Location:

    Ensure that the trust_policy.json file is in the same directory where you are running the AWS CLI commands. You can check the current directory using:

pwd

List the files in the directory to confirm the file is present:

    ls

Run the AWS CLI Command with the Correct Path:

    Use the relative path to the trust_policy.json file:

        aws iam create-role \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \
          --profile myprofile

If the file is in a different directory, you can specify the relative path. For example, if trust_policy.json is in a subdirectory called policies, you would use:

aws iam create-role \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://policies/trust_policy.json \
  --profile myprofile

Complete Steps with Profiles and Relative Path

Here are the complete steps again, ensuring the correct relative path is used:
Step 1: Create the IAM Role

    Create the Trust Policy Document:
        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }

Create the IAM Role:

    Run the following command to create the IAM role:

        aws iam create-role \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \
          --profile myprofile

Step 2: Attach the Necessary Policies to the Role

    Attach Policies:
        Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier policy (or another relevant policy) to the role:

        aws iam attach-role-policy \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \
          --profile myprofile

Step 3: Create the Instance Profile

    Create the Instance Profile:
        Run the following command to create the instance profile:

    aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \
      --profile myprofile

Add the Role to the Instance Profile:

    Run the following command to add the role to the instance profile:

        aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \
          --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --profile myprofile

Step 4: Update the env-config.json File

    Update the env-config.json File:
        Add the IamInstanceProfile option setting to your env-config.json file:

        [
          {
            "Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
            "OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
            "Value": "EBInstanceProfile"
          }
        ]

Step 5: Re-run the create-environment Command

    Re-run the Command:
        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file:

        aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \
          --application-name url-cleaner \
          --environment-name staging \
          --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21" \
          --option-settings file://env-config.json \
          --version-label v0.0.1 \
          --profile myprofile

Step 6: Verify the Environment

    Check the Environment Status:
        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.
        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.

By following these steps, you should be able to create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI, ensuring the correct AWS account profile and relative path are used.

Okay, it works now. What are the relevant policies to attach to the role?

The policies you attach to the IAM role will depend on the specific requirements of your Elastic Beanstalk environment and the services it interacts with. However, here are some commonly used AWS managed policies that are relevant for Elastic Beanstalk environments:
Common AWS Managed Policies

    AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier:
        This policy provides permissions for web server environments. It includes permissions to interact with various AWS services that are commonly used by web applications, such as S3, CloudWatch, and Elastic Load Balancing.

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \
  --profile myprofile

AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier:

    This policy provides permissions for worker environments. It includes permissions to interact with services like SQS, SNS, and CloudWatch.

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier \
  --profile myprofile

AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess:

    If your application needs to read from S3 buckets, you can attach this policy.

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess \
  --profile myprofile

AmazonS3FullAccess:

    If your application needs full access to S3 buckets, you can attach this policy.

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess \
  --profile myprofile

AmazonRDSFullAccess:

    If your application interacts with RDS databases, you can attach this policy.

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonRDSFullAccess \
  --profile myprofile

CloudWatchFullAccess:

    If your application needs to interact with CloudWatch for logging and monitoring, you can attach this policy.

    aws iam attach-role-policy \
      --role-name EBInstanceRole \
      --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchFullAccess \
      --profile myprofile

Custom Policies

If the AWS managed policies do not cover all your requirements, you can create custom policies. Here is an example of how to create a custom policy:

    Create a Custom Policy Document:
        Save the following JSON content as custom_policy.json:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObject",
            "logs:CreateLogGroup",
            "logs:CreateLogStream",
            "logs:PutLogEvents"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }

Create the Custom Policy:

    Run the following command to create the custom policy:

    aws iam create-policy \
      --policy-name EBCustomPolicy \
      --policy-document file://custom_policy.json \
      --profile myprofile

Attach the Custom Policy to the Role:

    Attach the custom policy to the role:

        aws iam attach-role-policy \
          --role-name EBInstanceRole \
          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:policy/EBCustomPolicy \
          --profile myprofile

Replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your actual AWS account ID.
Summary

The relevant policies to attach to the role depend on the specific needs of your application. The AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier and AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier policies are commonly used for Elastic Beanstalk environments. Additionally, you may need policies for interacting with other AWS services like S3, RDS, and CloudWatch. If the managed policies do not cover all your requirements, you can create custom policies to grant the necessary permissions.

By attaching the appropriate policies, you ensure that your Elastic Beanstalk environment has the permissions it needs to operate correctly.

Should the IamInstanceProfile value be "EBInstanceRole" or "EBInstanceProfile"?

The IamInstanceProfile value in your env-config.json file should be the name of the instance profile, not the role. In the steps provided earlier, we created an instance profile named EBInstanceProfile and associated the role EBInstanceRole with it.

Therefore, the value should be EBInstanceProfile.

Here is the correct configuration for your env-config.json file:

[
  {
    "Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
    "OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
    "Value": "EBInstanceProfile"
  }
]

Complete Steps Recap

    Create the IAM Role:

aws iam create-role \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \
  --profile myprofile

Attach Policies to the Role:

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name EBInstanceRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \
  --profile myprofile

Create the Instance Profile:

aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \
  --profile myprofile

Add the Role to the Instance Profile:

aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \
  --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \

      --profile myprofile

    Verify the Environment:
        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.
        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.

By following these steps and ensuring that the IamInstanceProfile value is set to EBInstanceProfile, you should be able to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment with the necessary IAM instance profile associated with it.

It was supposed to create a webapp based on a war file.

Here are all the events from the environment, which was then terminated without even creating an instance:

INFO

createEnvironment is starting.

Analysis of the Issue

Based on the provided AWS Elastic Beanstalk create environment command and the environment events, it appears that the environment creation failed due to the absence of an associated instance profile.

Key Findings

    The environment creation command was executed with the --profile option set to myprofile, but this option is used to specify the AWS CLI profile to use for authentication, not to associate an instance profile with the environment.
    The environment events indicate that the environment creation failed with an error message stating that "Environment must have instance profile associated with it."
    The instance profile is a critical component of an Elastic Beanstalk environment, as it defines the IAM roles and permissions for the EC2 instances in the environment.

Solution

To resolve this issue, you need to associate an instance profile with the environment. Here are the steps to follow:

    Create an instance profile:
        Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM dashboard.
        Click on "Roles" in the left-hand menu and then click on "Create role".
        Select "AWS service" as the trusted entity type and choose "EC2" as the service that the role will be used with.
        Click on "Next" and attach the necessary policies to the role (e.g., AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier, AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier, etc.).
        Click on "Next" and enter a name for the role (e.g., my-instance-profile).
        Click on "Create role".
    Associate the instance profile with the environment:
        Update the env-config.json file to include the instance profile:


{
"Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
"OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
"Value": "my-instance-profile"
}

   * Alternatively, you can use the `--option-settings` option when running the `create-environment` command to specify the instance profile:
     ```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \
  --application-name url-cleaner \
  --environment-name staging \
  --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21" \
  --option-settings file://env-config.json \
  --version-label v0.0.1 \
  --profile myprofile \
  --option-settings Namespace=aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration,OptionName=IamInstanceProfile,Value=my-instance-profile

    Retry the environment creation:
        Run the create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file or the additional --option-settings option.

By following these steps, you should be able to associate an instance profile with the environment and successfully create the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

Can this IAM role be created via the CLI?

Creating an IAM Role via the AWS CLI

Yes, you can create an IAM role via the AWS CLI using the create-role command. Here's an example of how to create an IAM role for an Elastic Beanstalk environment:

Step 1: Create a trust policy document

Create a file named trust-policy.json with the following contents:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

This trust policy grants the EC2 service permission to assume the role.

Step 2: Create the IAM role

Run the following command to create the IAM role:

aws iam create-role \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json

This command creates a new IAM role named my-instance-profile with the specified trust policy.

Step 3: Attach policies to the IAM role

Attach the necessary policies to the IAM role using the attach-role-policy command. For example:

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier

These commands attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier and AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier policies to the my-instance-profile IAM role.

Step 4: Update the env-config.json file

Update the env-config.json file to include the instance profile:

{
  "Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
  "OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
  "Value": "my-instance-profile"
}

Step 5: Retry the environment creation

Retry the environment creation using the create-environment command with the updated env-config.json file.

By following these steps, you can create an IAM role for your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI.

    when creating the role (first command), I get the following error: An error occurred (MalformedPolicyDocument) when calling the CreateRole operation: This policy contains invalid Json
    do I need to include --profile myprofile to ensure it uses the correct AWS account?

Resolving the MalformedPolicyDocument Error

    The MalformedPolicyDocument error is likely due to the Sid field in the trust policy document. The Sid field is optional, but if you include it, you must provide a value. Try removing the Sid field from the trust-policy.json file:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

If you prefer to keep the Sid field, you can provide a value, such as a descriptive string:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EC2AssumeRolePolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

Specifying the AWS Profile

    Yes, if you have multiple AWS profiles configured on your system, you should include the --profile option to specify the correct AWS account to use. For example:

aws iam create-role \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json

This ensures that the create-role command is executed using the credentials from the myprofile profile.

Additionally, you should include the --profile option when attaching policies to the role and when creating the environment:

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier

aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \
  --profile myprofile \
  --application-name url-cleaner \
  --environment-name staging \
  --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21" \
  --option-settings file://env-config.json \
  --version-label v0.0.1

Error parsing parameter '--assume-role-policy-document': Unable to load paramfile file://trust_policy.json: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'trust_policy.json'

Is there a way to pass trust_policy.json's relative path?

Passing the Absolute Path to the trust-policy.json File

Yes, you can pass the absolute path to the trust-policy.json file. To do this, you can use the pwd command to get the current working directory and then append the relative path to the trust-policy.json file.

Here's an example:

aws iam create-role \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://`pwd`/trust-policy.json

The pwd command returns the current working directory, and the / character is used to append the relative path to the trust-policy.json file.

Alternatively, you can specify the absolute path manually:

aws iam create-role \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --assume-role-policy-document file:///path/to/trust-policy.json

Replace /path/to/ with the actual path to the trust-policy.json file.

Specifying the Relative Path

If you want to specify the relative path, you can use the ./ notation:

aws iam create-role \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --assume-role-policy-document file:./trust-policy.json

The ./ notation tells the AWS CLI to look for the trust-policy.json file in the current working directory.

Make sure to check that the trust-policy.json file is in the correct location and that the path you specify is correct.

Okay, it works now. What are the relevant policies to attach to the role?

Relevant Policies for the Elastic Beanstalk Environment

For an Elastic Beanstalk environment, you'll typically need to attach policies that grant the necessary permissions for the EC2 instances to operate correctly. Here are some relevant policies to consider:

    AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier: This policy provides permissions for the web tier of an Elastic Beanstalk environment, including accessing the Elastic Beanstalk service, uploading logs to S3, and using the EC2 API.
    AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier: This policy provides permissions for the worker tier of an Elastic Beanstalk environment, including accessing the Elastic Beanstalk service, uploading logs to S3, and using the SQS API.
    AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess: This policy provides read-only access to the EC2 service, which is necessary for the EC2 instances to retrieve metadata and configure themselves.
    CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess: This policy provides read-only access to the CloudWatch Logs service, which is necessary for the EC2 instances to upload logs.

You can attach these policies to the role using the attach-role-policy command:

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --profile myprofile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess

Note that the exact policies you need to attach may vary depending on the specific requirements of your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

Custom Policies

If you need to grant additional permissions to the EC2 instances, you can create a custom policy and attach it to the role. For example, you might need to grant access to an S3 bucket or a DynamoDB table. You can create a custom policy using the AWS IAM console or the AWS CLI.

Remember to review the policies you attach to the role and ensure that they align with the least privilege principle, granting only the necessary permissions for the EC2 instances to operate correctly.

Should the IamInstanceProfile value be "EBInstanceRole" or "EBInstanceProfile"?

Correct Value for IamInstanceProfile

The correct value for the IamInstanceProfile option should be the name of the IAM instance profile that you created, not EBInstanceRole or EBInstanceProfile.

In your case, since you created an IAM role named my-instance-profile and then created an IAM instance profile named my-instance-profile, the correct value for the IamInstanceProfile option should be my-instance-profile.

However, it seems that you might have missed creating the IAM instance profile. To create an IAM instance profile, you can use the following command:

aws iam create-instance-profile \
  --profile myprofile \
  --instance-profile-name my-instance-profile

Then, you need to add the IAM role to the instance profile:

aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \
  --profile myprofile \
  --instance-profile-name my-instance-profile \
  --role-name my-instance-profile

After creating the IAM instance profile and adding the IAM role to it, you can use the my-instance-profile value for the IamInstanceProfile option.

Note that EBInstanceRole and EBInstanceProfile are default values used by Elastic Beanstalk, but you should use the name of the IAM instance profile that you created.

Here's the correct env-config.json file:

{
  "Namespace": "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration",
  "OptionName": "IamInstanceProfile",
  "Value": "my-instance-profile"
}
