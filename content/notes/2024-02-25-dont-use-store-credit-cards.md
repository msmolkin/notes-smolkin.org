## Think Twice Before Applying for a Capital One (or Retail Store) Credit Card

LPT: do NOT use Capital One to apply for a credit card, unless you haven't applied for any other credit in the last 5 years (e.g. if this is your first card).

They do a HARD PULL on each major credit bureau.

When applying for your first credit card, it can be tempting to simply go with the first bank that approves you. However, you should be cautious about applying for a Capital One card if you have limited credit history.

Unlike many other major banks, Capital One runs a hard inquiry on all three major credit bureaus - Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion - when you apply for one of their cards. This means they will check your credit report with each bureau, which will result in three hard inquiries on your report rather than just one.

Too many credit checks in a short period of time can negatively impact your credit score. Hard inquiries can lower your score, especially if you don't have a long credit history already established.

Therefore, Capital One credit card applications should be avoided if you have limited credit or intend to apply for other credit soon. If it's your first ever card application and you're a student, those three hard inquiries could be okay. They also require proof of employment, so be ready to ask for or fabricate a letter from your employer (in my case, I had to do both: I was given free reign to write the letter, as long as I wrote it myself).

The same, multiplied several times, goes for retail store cards like those from Nordstrom - they often result in multiple hard inquiries as well. For example, Nordstrom has TD Bank perform hard credit checks on applicants, which in my case meant two hard inquiries on my Experian report. Worse, Nordstrom is the only lender to have ever *rejected* my credit card application. If it's your first ever card application, those extra hard inquiries could end up lowering a credit score that you worked hard to build.

Other major credit card companies, like Chase and Citi, often only check one bureau for initial applications. This results in less of an impact to your score if you are rate shopping for your first card. By minimizing hard inquiries - especially at the start of building your credit - you reduce potential damage to your credit score.

By all means, Capital One offers some excellent, in fact somewhat stellar, credit card products. However, you are better off applying to them after you have established solid credit history - or only if you have not applied for any other credit in the past 5 years. One hard inquiry won't hurt as much after you have built up positive credit for a while. But at the start, it's wise to minimize hard checks whenever possible.
