Again, ahead of the game. I generate custom commands that I say, and then I tell my phone what to do and it does it. I did it for learning Cerego gestures, and I'm doing it again for deleting these old listings (because it's easier than restarting the machine I'm working on). See recording from right now to watch it in action. I could automate it futher, but it's not worth the time.
