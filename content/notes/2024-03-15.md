That's it. Just read the article.

Also, what the fuck? Following links from the CDC, I end up on a site where I can get free naloxone (presumably, $EBS makes a shitton off of it as the fed. government pays for the Narcan to make it free). And what do I see?
> If you are a person who uses drugs, have been recently released from jail or prison, or if you are a friend, family member, or partner of of someone who may be at high-risk for an opioid overdose, you can have naloxone **discretely** mailed to you at no cost. We partner with SANE (Safe Alternatives Thru Networking And Education) in Sacramento to provide this service.

**discretely**. They'll send it to you **discretely**. I get that your iPhone can't differentiate between "its" and "it's" (it often [gets it wrong](#insert a link to an article here about the its/it's snafu where iPhone generally corrects the wrong way)), but someone should be able to see it and fix it. Why can't we at least run these multibillion-dollar programs through simple grammar checkers?

By the way, if you want naloxone to carry with you, you can get some [here](https://nextdistro.org/cachoice).

> Thanks to a partnership between NEXT Harm Reduction and [SANE (Safe Alternatives Thru Networking And Education)](https://www.cleanneedles.org), mail-based naloxone services are available for California residents. Mail-based services are specifically designed to support individuals who are unable or unwilling to access in-person services. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to [reach out](https://nextdistro.org/contact).

Oh, here's a company that's probably earning a pretty penny for doing nothing.
