# What the fuck, Apple?

Apparently my new iPhone has iCloud photos turned on automatically, and saved all the photos I've taken on it.

Thankfully, I haven't *really* used it in the few weeks I've had it, but what if I had?

What if I had private photos, and they pushed them onto my iCloud? Or incriminating photos?
