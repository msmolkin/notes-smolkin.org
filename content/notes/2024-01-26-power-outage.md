Me:
	Another power outage?
	It’s back

My Dad:
	Xfinity reported to us but not PGE

Me:
	For about a minute, my computer stopped charging and then the routers died
	I clicked the button to report it and the said “checking” and then it turned back on

D:
	PGE just called

Me:
	👍 
	Вы вовремя уехали
	It just died again
	I’m disconnecting my laptop so it doesn’t kill it

M (sarcastically):
	Did they not include their test outage?
