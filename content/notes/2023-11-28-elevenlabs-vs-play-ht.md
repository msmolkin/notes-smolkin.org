# Elevenlabs vs. Play.ht

In today’s digital content landscape, there’s an ever-growing demand for tools that can seamlessly convert text to audio, bringing written content to life with the power of voice and Elevenlabs and Play.ht are heralded as top contenders in the text to speech domain. In this article, we dive deep into a side-by-side comparison of these two industry leaders, evaluating their features, capabilities, pricing, and more, as well as explore an alternative to guide you in making an informed decision.

## What is ElevenLabs?

ElevenLabs, a renowned American software company, has made waves with its advanced text to speech (TTS) software. It capitalizes on artificial intelligence and deep learning, presenting lifelike, high-quality speech in a variety of languages and voices. The software’s distinct advantage is its ability to convey emotions and nuances in its synthetic voices, rivaling the expressiveness of the human voice.

## What is Play.ht?

Play.ht is a dynamic startup that leverages AI speech synthesis technology and machine learning to transform text into high-quality, natural-sounding voice overs suitable for various applications such as podcasts, audio content, and chatbots. This user-friendly AI voice generator is a cutting-edge solution for businesses and individuals alike.

## ElevenLabs history

Based in New York City, ElevenLabs is an AI voice company that was established in 2022 by Piotr Dabkowski, an ex-machine learning engineer from Google, and Mati Staniszewski, a former deployment strategist at Palantir. Piotr Dabkowski now holds the title of CTO, with Mati Staniszewski as the CEO.

In a mere year after its formation, by January 2023, ElevenLabs had secured an impressive $2 million in pre-seed investments. Their progress was steadfast; by June 2023, they had procured a substantial $19 million in a Series A investment round, elevating their valuation to a commendable $100 million. Remarkably, they accomplished all this without a conventional office setup and a compact team of only 15 members.

## Play.ht history

Play.ht began in 2016 as a Chrome extension that enabled users to add audio to their Medium articles. But visionaries and co-founders Syed Hammad Ahmed and Mahmoud Felfel, saw greater potential. In 2017, they broadened the service, turning Play.ht from simply a listening apparatus to a robust platform that helps both individuals and businesses create authentic audio content.

Play.ht’s financial journey has been commendable. Initiating its funding milestones, the startup locked in its pre-seed funding on January 1, 2023. This crucial phase attracted hefty investments from two leading venture capital entities, Y Combinator and 500 Global, pooling in a combined amount of $125K into the burgeoning enterprise.

## How ElevenLabs works

ElevenLabs, as an AI-driven voice over platform, generates human-like speech from text. Users typically start by inputting their written content into the platform, choosing from a wide range of voice types, accents, and languages available. Once the preferred settings are selected, the AI processes the text, and within moments, it delivers a realistic voice over. The platform’s flexibility allows users to customize the pitch, speed, and tone of the voice to best fit the intended purpose.

Additionally, with the continuous training of its models, ElevenLabs ensures that the quality of its voice overs remains state-of-the-art, making it an invaluable tool for businesses, content creators, and professionals seeking high-quality voice narrations without human intervention.

## How Play.ht works

Play.ht provides a solution for converting written text into lifelike audio using its AI technology. To begin, users upload or type in their text on the platform. From there, they can select from an array of voice options, each with distinct tones, accents, and characteristics. Once a voice is selected, Play.ht’s AI gets to work, analyzing the text and producing an audio file that closely mimics human speech.

Play.ht also offers features like the ability to adjust the speech rate, insert pauses, and emphasize specific words, allowing for tailored audio experiences. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, Play.ht serves a wide audience, from podcasters and educators to businesses looking to offer audio versions of their written content.
