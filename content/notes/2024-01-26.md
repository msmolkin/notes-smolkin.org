Okay, same issue as [[2023-01-19]] @ 10:35a. I'll try to make this explanation slightly more verbose, even though the other one was sufficient for me to understand what to do.

Previous explanation:
I think the reason the sync wasn't working is that .git-notes stopped being on this device. OneDrive farmed it out to the cloud. Hence all the `fatal: not a git repository: '.super-secret-hidden-git-repo'`

New explanation:
Problem: `fatal: not a git repository: '.super-secret-hidden-git-repo'`
Reason: `.super-secret-hidden-git-repo` stopped being on this device. OneDrive farmed it out to the cloud.
Solution: Download `.hidden-git-repo`.
How to download: Actually, manually go into the folder and download it, both pressing "Always Keep on This Device" in the right-click context menu and physically clicking on the cloud.

How to check that it's solved: `⌘i` — confirm that size on disk >= size

(Miscellaneous: based on looking through it for quite a few minutes, my understanding is the following:
1. My file system uses 4 kilobytes per file minimum, so a 23 byte file will use 4 kilobytes
2. and also there is a way for it to be shorter. I saw some folders with 1 file inside and it was classified as "2 items." So, when I saw a folder with "5 items" that was 8 KB on disk, that makes sense too — as long as 3 of the "items" are folders and only 2 are files, or 4 of them are folders and one of them is a file that is > 4 KB and < 8KB
)
There goes half an hour of my time.

And another ~hour was spent alternating between public-facing, common LLMs to write a LinkedIn post I'll never send. I really should publish (at least some) things.
On the bright side, I did finally hit apply to a position, even if it is a specialized pos. at Google, which is unattainable. And it was such a short process, taking all of a minute or two, IIRC. There are so many *bad* companies out there, which will pay me modest amounts to do basically nothing and think I'm a genius... why do I waste my life trying to get into the top companies and get paid enormous sums and build relationships with the best people (okay, I know exactly why I do it) and try to get project ideas off the ground? I'm broke and stupid (relatively speaking). Just get some money, throw it all at college (I'm withering away my best learning years doing nothing productive).
