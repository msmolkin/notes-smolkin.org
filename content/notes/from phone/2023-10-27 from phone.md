Food for thought:

2:32 PM -04:00 (1698431532208)
Question. I saw a waymo barreling towards me, and I thought that I could jump out at it. What would the car do if an idiot ran right into the street as it was in the right lane or literally jumped straight in front of the car? Equivalent of walking in front of a moving bus. And are there any legal implications?

But, more importantly/interestingly/relevant for me, it becomes the trolley problem: do you continue going and just slam on the brakes, almost certainly crippling the person if not killing them, or do you veer left and potentially crash into another car? Does it depend on whether there are other cars on your left, if it's possible to sneak in and turn in such a way that you don't crash into anyone (however, knowing that the other cars are driven by human drivers, who might panic and then crash into someone else, would you then be liable for their actions if they decide that you're not able to make it and then they crash into someone else?)

Or, given that you are autonomous and there is no human involved, do you also consider an option that a human would not have available to them: alongside slamming on the brakes, you turn the wheel fully *right*, actively crashing straight into a house or bus station or a sidewalk, but preventing nearly all casualties or even harm completely? It ends up being a $300,000 loss as the car becomes totaled, but it prevents any harm to human life. I think that's probably the most effective way when it's an option (because what if there are people at the bus stop as well, or the material making up the wall is flimsy if it's a house, so it still remains the trolley problem, where turning away from the suicide suspect and into a group of innocents it's still deciding whether to kill one or five)?
