Excuse me @OpenAI, but what is this?

Would you please include a “copy all” button in chats (at least mobile chats), so I (the user) can restart the same chat without losing all my data from the previous one?

Update: I fix this by going to the previous response, pressing and holding it, and pressing regenerate. Then I can paste my question and it answers it. Having already read the original "Previous response," I don't have to read the new one because I know what it's about (the way it was worded it is just changed).
