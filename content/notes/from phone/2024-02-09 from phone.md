Something no one mentions when talking about USB Type-C, at least as far as I've noticed:

One super convenient thing about it is that I already bought an adapter for my Mac that uses USB type C and converts USB type A and HDMI. This means that I can now connect my phone to an HDMI monitor without having to buy any of those special Micro USB to HDMI or mini USB to HDMI or Lightning to HDMI adapters that serve one function and one function only.

But it drains the battery awfully fast. It drains it the rate of about one percent per minute on an iPhone 15 Pro
