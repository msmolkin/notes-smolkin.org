I just walked into a bookstore. I happen to pass by the religion section. I glanced at the Judaism section, which is so small that the sign covers some Christianity and some atheism. There are literally TWO Jewish books in the entire bookstore. And it finally hit me. The reason we see what we see in the US is that it's a consumerist society. You provide people with the news that will let you sell them something. Jews don't buy a lot, so it's economically disadvantageous to promote true Jewish history except at the highest levels, in opera or art. And the (ugly) flip side of this token: itâ€™s economically advantageous to sell the story that will cause people to buy more things, and that means that you sell the narrative appeals to the people more willing to spend money
