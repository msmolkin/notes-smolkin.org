Nice. I just checked out a library look by using a barcode generator app on my phone. First, I had to pick one, and they all have subscriptions, so I guess I'll have to build my own version of the app. I don't want to keep using it. Then, I decided which one I was going to use. The first one that showed up with tons of 5-star reviews was super confusing and impossible to use, so I didn't choose that one.

So I picked the second one. And it has a 3-day free trial, followed by a monthly purchase. Or alternatively, you can pay the annual price once, immediately. So I picked the trial. I put in my primary card number. It easily generated it. And generated it correctly. And... the library card reader accepted it. And asked me for my pin. I checked out my book without any problems. That I had on hold without any problems. Then I decided to try it with a different book. Because they currently use what I believe are RFID tags on all their books, I wasn't able to test it perfectly, because it had already found which book I was checking out just because I had placed the book in the right spot. So I went over to a different shelf. Picked a book that seems more or less interesting. And I'll probably skim that very quickly. I'll probably run through the entire book in about 5 minutes or 10 minutes. It's called Behavioral Economics: a very short introduction by Michelle Baddeley. From the Oxford University Press. Also very light, which made it a good candidate.

Anyway, this time I placed the book to the side to make sure that it wasn't read prematurely. Used the barcode that I generated for my library card number again. Manually entered my pin code and then generated the barcode that's on the book in the barcode generator app. The code is 31223, 12225, 1771. I accidentally missed one of those three 2s in the middle, and so the reader said, please take this item to the desk. This code is invalid. I retyped the code, although I realized as I was typing it in that I probably should have scanned it using the scanner portion of the app to see if there's anything additional in this barcode other than just this number. Something that, say, relates it to the library so that it knows that it's their code. So I generated the code properly. I figured that if there's a problem, then I'll scan it right after. Scanned that code the same way that you would in the past with books, and it accepted it perfectly, saying that I just checked out this book to my library card. Now, all that's left for someone before they take your card and checkbooks out with it is NB. It's important to note that you can't check books in yourself. That's done by a volunteer or worker at the library, so they have that part covered. Is that they need to know your PIN. Ellipsis, which is just your date of birth, your year of birth, your birth year. So I scanned it, and I was done! Exclamation point. New paragraph. By the way, the reason that I'm doing this is because I'm going to be doing a lot of writing. New paragraph. By the way, the reason that you might be seeing text that literally says exclamation point or new paragraph is because I generally write using Apple's dictation. But nowadays I've switched to using OpenAI's Whisper as it's more effective. It seems Apple either deteriorates the quality of their microphones, or maybe my microphones just get clogged with dust and dirt and debris with time, and I just haven't cleaned them.

And OpenAI transcription doesn't respond to saying things such as “exclamation mark” by writing an exclamation mark. Semicolon. Rather comma. It writes the word instead. One final point. [Edit: Yes, I could've removed this while editing, but I actually purposely decided to leave it in to make my point.] When it asked me how I wanted the receipt, printed, via email, or no receipt, where I usually press no receipt— because why would I need a receipt saying that I checked a book out? If anything, I need a receipt saying that I returned it.—if you press the email button, then the machine displays the email address you're sending it to on the screen, which could be a potential security risk if someone has access to your PIN and checks out a book. And they now have whatever email you gave the library on file. Whatever email the library has on file for you becomes visible to that person.

So that leaves me with one final thought. I should build a barcode generator and reader app.
