How I thought today:
Told my parents a couple weeks back, once my brother, who bought it in the 1700s, told them to sell gold, because the investment idea was over, that they should wait just a bit.

Thankfully, I’ve read a bit of Seykota’s ideas—he would always buy when everyone else was selling to eke out that last little bit. I even saw it play out with GameStop a couple years back. Burry sold once the investment thesis was over, and that’s when the insanity began. Anyway, I think it’ll be time to sell gold soon.

Here’s the conversations that played out today:

During the day:
> Gold hit 2260 today. Currently at 2230

During the evening:

Would you let me know if anyone suggests buying gold sometime soon (without you bringing it up)

—

Would you like me to ask around or just let you know if I hear about buying gold? 

—

The way I figure it, there are two sell signals. Well, actually it’s the same one (once investment thesis turns into speculation), but it manifests in two ways: either I hear that people want to buy it or the ETF holding it goes from trading at a discount to trading at a premium)

(Definitions:
ETF = exchange traded fund. Gold ETF is a fancy way to say “container that holds gold”
Premium = it trades for more than the value of the underlying gold it holds
Discount = it trades for less than the value of the underlying)

—

In short, as I’ve mentioned before: once the ETF he chose starts finally trading at a premium, the way MSTR is, that’s when you sell.
