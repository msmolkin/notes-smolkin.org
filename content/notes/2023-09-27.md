Problem with Hugo:

When I have two dollar signs, it seems to always think it's an expression. Even when I escape the first (or both) dollar sign. \$for example\$

\$ example with spaces surrounding them \$

\$ example with space after the first dollar sign\$

\$example with space before second one \$

\$example with no spaces\$

None of these *should* be treated as formulas. But some of them do.
