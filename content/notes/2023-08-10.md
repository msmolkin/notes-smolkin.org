Fuck the corporate system. I spent *years* being honest. One day, I spoke to someone and decided, "fuck it." I spammed my résumé with a *ton* of services.

Four years of my life down the drain, not knowing how to make money, and suddenly I had 12 million in the bank and 4 jobs that I was holding down without a sweat.
