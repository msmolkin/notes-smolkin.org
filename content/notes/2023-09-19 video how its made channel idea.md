This video has been made by humans, but it could have just been like one or two or five.
1. Have davinci generate the script
2. Have a voice actor read it (more likely, it's generated. e.g. (not the best one) see 7m00s, "ice cream" 08m00s "this video" 08m11s "bye for now"— you can hear the computer speech artifacts)
3. Then get the videos. How and where those are picked up?That's manual, I think.
4. Add sound effects, like the shutter click that was added (probably either to cover up a sound that they didn't want the user to hear or more likely to generate a transition)
