This is one reason not to rely on others. The tools that I used for building my websites no longer work. I still don't get that in policies. I understand if newer protocols are instituted, and I understand if it costs money to maintain, but you put out a product that people relied on, and you marketed it as the next big thing. How can you allow the tool that's saved on my computer to stop working? I'm not even requiring your server to work, just the tool itself.

My website builders actually stopped working a long time ago, but I'll just post about it now, when I remember and have the drive to. I've never had the time to actually check how to fix it, as I would just pop open the app and try to edit the website, get distracted after a few minutes while the app was loading, and then, when I'd come back, it would still be loading, and I will just leave it open in case it fixed itself, for days or weeks on end.

I figure it's time to mention to anyone reading why it hasn't been updated in such a long time.
