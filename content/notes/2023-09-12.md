had to reset obs, so I'll force the trick now

You can see it very clearly at this time:
It generates a "hidden" phrase while it's talking that occurs at the end of the list, and then deletes it. if I have settings pulled up while it's talking, then it never deletes the "HiddenPhraseToAvoidCrash"

Extracting this for blog, as it's pretty cool

To reproduce:
`System Settings > Spoken Content > Speak Announcements > Play Sample`
While it's playing, `Phrase > Edit Phrase List`
