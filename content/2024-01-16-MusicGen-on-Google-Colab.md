### Navigating AI Music Generation: My Personal Exploration with MusicGen on Google Colab

Anyone who knows me knows this:
The one thing that I've always beenâ€œ too lazy to do is write-ups. I do the work, but I never write it up. But how can I add it to my resume as even a pet project if I have nothing but the code to show for it? So I guess I'll have to at least have a model generate the mock-ups for the writing, and then I'll go over it if I'm not too lazy. You know the reason I opened my computer tonight was just to get a certificate for a course I just finished on my phone today? And, well, you can see the result of opening my laptop, below...

Dive in (if you dare)!

PS: I guess I'll start reading through the model's work next time (and fine-tuning it on my own writing).
PPS: Feel free to ask me for the IPYNB file if you want it as a file, but here's a [link to the notebook it was downloaded from](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Txynj0NCp4QJK5vjU2LLRRmNwQBm_rVw?authuser=2) (you should download a copy yourself, in File > Download, since you have access).

#### Intro: Discovering MusicGen in the Cloud

My latest personal project led me to the fascinating intersection of AI and music, specifically through MusicGen, an AI model for generating music. This exploration was conducted on Google Colab, a platform that became my go-to solution after various trials and errors in getting everything to work seamlessly.

#### Setting the Stage in the Cloud

Google Colab provided the ideal environment for this project, offering the necessary computational resources. The setup involved installing `audiocraft` to access MusicGen and importing crucial modules like `musicgen` from `audiocraft` and `torch`. This was akin to preparing my digital workspace for the task at hand.

#### Engaging with the AI Composer

I initiated the MusicGen model, opting for its 'large' version, and set it to create a piece of music lasting 120 seconds. The experience of commanding an AI to generate music was both intriguing and empowering, revealing the capabilities of modern technology.

#### The Music Generation Saga

The actual process of generating music was an adventure in itself. Using prompts such as 'mozart fantasia', I steered the AI to produce music in specific styles. The `display_audio` function allowed me to listen to the AI-crafted compositions, adding an auditory dimension to the data.

#### Trials and Tribulations: Resource Management

My journey wasn't without its challenges. Initially, I attempted to generate five 8-second music pieces on a T4 CPU, which took 35 seconds. Attempts to create longer pieces led to timeouts and memory issues, revealing the limitations of the free version of Google Colab. I encountered an `OutOfMemoryError` due to insufficient GPU RAM, prompting me to delve into memory management within the Python and PyTorch frameworks.

#### Overcoming Technical Hurdles

My notes from this phase include a mixture of frustration and breakthroughs. There were moments when I pondered over the model's performance and its resource demands. To manage this, I used commands to clear memory, which I humorously noted might affect other users on the same GPU. Here, the technical aspect of the project became a learning curve in efficient coding and resource utilization.

#### Final Success: Generating and Downloading the Music

After navigating these challenges and waiting for access to Google Colab's T4 system, I managed to generate a single audio file, as detailed in the IPython notebook. The final step involved converting the audio data to a CPU-compatible format using `.cpu().numpy()`, playing it, and saving it as a WAV file. I then successfully located and downloaded this piece from Google Colab's environment, marking the completion of a significant personal achievement.

#### Reflecting on My AI Music Journey

This project was more than just an exploration of AI's role in music creation; it was a personal journey through the challenges and rewards of working with advanced technology. The process highlighted the blend of technical know-how and creative input required to produce AI-generated music.

#### Closing Thoughts

Engaging with MusicGen on Google Colab has been a rewarding experience, offering insights into the potentials and limitations of AI in creative domains. This journey has not only enhanced my understanding of AI and music but also emphasized the importance of patience and perseverance in the face of technical challenges.

#### Monetizing AI Music Generation: The Next Big Step

As I reflect on my journey with MusicGen and the immense potential it holds, it becomes evident that there's a substantial opportunity here â€“ the chance to monetize this cutting-edge technology. Picture this: a dedicated platform, similar to audiogen.co, but for MusicGen. I'm thinking of something along the lines of musicgen.co, musicgen.ai, or musicgen.io.

#### The Concept: A User-Friendly AI Music Service

The idea is simple yet powerful. Create a user-friendly interface where users input a prompt and the length of the piece they desire. With a click on "Generate," they receive their unique AI-composed music piece. Imagine the convenience and the creative possibilities this would offer to users from various backgrounds, be it amateur music enthusiasts, content creators, or even professional musicians.

#### Pricing Strategy: Catering to All

To make this service accessible yet profitable, a tiered pricing strategy could be the key. Start with a free version that allows users to generate a single 8-second piece, giving them a taste of the model's capabilities. This approach mirrors the experience I had using the provided Colab notebook.

Then, introduce a paid version priced at $29.99/month, offering enhanced features like the ability to generate multiple pieces or longer compositions. For those on a tighter budget, a more affordable tier at $5 or $10 per month could provide a balanced mix of features and accessibility.

And for the professionals who demand the highest level of creative freedom and output, a pro version priced between $100â€“400 per month could grant full access to the model's capabilities, catering to their extensive needs.

#### The Future: A Symphony of Technology and Commerce

This venture isn't just about selling a product; it's about pioneering a new form of musical expression and making it widely available. It's about bridging the gap between advanced AI technology and everyday creativity. With the right execution, this could mark the beginning of a new era in music creation, where AI becomes an integral tool in the artist's palette, accessible to all who seek to explore the boundless realms of musical creativity.

As I conclude this project, I find myself at the threshold of an exciting new venture, one that combines my passion for technology and music with the practicalities of business. It's time to take this journey to the next stage and see where it can lead in the world of AI and music.
