Prompted me to finally start this public blog. I'd publish everything on here, but my writing has thoughts that, well, shouldn't be public. Any interactions that could be questionable were always positive interactions from all parties. But my thoughts were not.\n\n10:59am -07:00 (1690307982634)\nRight now, this isn't what anyone is saying, but this is my (hot) take:\nPeople are saying turning Twitter into X is a mistake. I disagree. If I remember right, X.Com was the original name of PayPal, so Musk has a connection to it. Model X and SpaceX are testaments to the same (yes, I know the consumer cars Tesla released spell out SX3Y, an anagram for sexy, but I stand by my conviction that the letter X has a special meaning to the man).\n@elonmusk Musk overpaid for Twitter. The issue for him, the reason that he kept talking about the number of bots and the overplayed, exaggerated bot statistics, was that he was just paying too much for this website. His \"cost per click\"/\"cost per mille\"/cost per consumer was far higher than it should have been. He was buying the company just for their network and their worldwide reach. (of course, their near-instantaneous infrastructure was also good, but it wasn't the most important thing, because he can always hire engineers to replace their infrastructure). The same reason JP Morgan bought Frank.\nBut he's doing everything right. He gets a network, then he links it to X. Eventually, his hope is that X becomes a world-wide payment system, where you think about a car and a Tesla drives up to you and gets you to your destination, and the payment is handled in the background. The idea is there. With my background in neuroscience, I'd like to be on the Neuralink side of things, but I hope that my application will be by manual introduction.","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.130121475Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-07-26":{"title":"2023-07-26 Creating a simple transcription/translation script with AWS","content":"\n### aws file transcription\n\nTL;DR: Still not finished. This tells you how to take an audio file, upload it to AWS (assuming you've already created a bucket[^4]), create a user account (they call it an \"IAM User\") with the necessary permissions, transcribe the file, and then manually submit a batch job to translate it. Translating via terminal/programmatically is a headache that I still haven't figured out. It involves temporary permissions (they call them \"IAM Roles\"), instead of just giving the user account permission. That's all that's remaining for this to be a complete tutorial to automate permissions.\n\n[^4]: either with something like `aws s3 mb recordings` or manually via the website\n\nBonus! I also included a [[2023-07-26 GPT prompt]]\n\n##### Create user to do transcriptions\nRun the following commands in the cloud console (or on your machine which already has access to the AWS CLI. Since I didn't want to bother with downloading and configuring the CLI, I chose the cloud console). To access the console Go to `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users` -\u003e and click on the console button, which looks like this: \u003ca class=\"globalNav-0291 globalNav-029 globalNav-0210 _icon-color_izqbm_6\" href=\"https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1\" title=\"CloudShell\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" id=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-testid=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-tools-experience-ingress-point=\"cloudshell-icon-header\"\u003e\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"2.0\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"globalNav-0216\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M5 5l2.997 2.998L5 11m4.997-.002H12m3-7.626A2.374 2.374 0 0012.627 1H3.37A2.372 2.372 0 001 3.372v9.256a2.373 2.373 0 002.37 2.373h9.257A2.375 2.375 0 0015 12.628V3.372z\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-miterlimit=\"1.5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" fill=\"none\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n1. `aws iam create-user --user-name TranscribeUser`\n2. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`\n3. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonTranscribeFullAccess`\n4. `aws iam create-access-key --user-name TranscribeUser` [^1]\n5. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/TranslateFullAccess` (figured it out by running ~~```export POLICYARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`TranslateFullAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)```~~ `aws iam list-policies` from AWS's [how-to page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-iam-policy.html) and searching through the results)\n\n##### Upload files and run transcription command\n6. Then figure out how to upload the files from my Mac to the S3 bucket programmatically. For now, uploaded manually by opening the [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/upload/recordings.smolkin.org?region=us-west-1)\n\t1. I set this up on EC2 and did this just a couple days ago with the log files, so it can't be too hard to set up on my Mac\n\t2. Here's the command I'll run: `aws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` \n7. When using the AWS CLI, you'll need to handle special characters, such as spaces, by enclosing the S3 URL in double quotes to prevent parsing errors. Well, you should escape the spaces in the S3 URL using backslashes or enclose it in double quotes, if there's an error.[^2] \n8. Transcribe the recordings (can be run inside cloud console as well). \n\t1. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to get GPT-3.5 to generate the command properly for me.[^2] FINALLY! The issue was how `--media` was supposed to be handled: `--media MediaFileUri=s3://{bucket_name}/path/to/file`\n\t2. Update: it's best to put these inside a separate folder that contains nothing from previous days, as all files in this directory will be used when generating the translation. So don't use `recordings.smokin.org/results`, rather use `recordings.smolkin.org/results/transcriptions/{today's date}`\n```\n# Transcribe New Recording 8.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 8.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n# Transcribe New Recording 9.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 9.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n```\n\n##### Retrieve completed transcriptions\n9. List all transcription jobs in your AWS account, including their status, and you can check if the new job with your specified job name has completed successfully: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs`\n\t1. You can also run it with the specific job name: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews']\"`\n10. Once the transcription job is completed (i.e. `TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=={JobName}][\"TranscriptionJobStatus\"] == \"COMPLETED\"`, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results: `aws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --output json`\n11. This part is much better to do once you have that IAM access working (otherwise, accessing files is a huge pain with AWS S3): The transcription results are stored in the S3 bucket and folder/object specified by the `OutputBucketName` and `OutputKey` parameters when the job was created. You can use the `cp` command to copy the transcription file from S3 to the local computer/server: `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews.json ./`, `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia.json ./`\n12. Create a transitional text file that will be used for the automated translation. Also, this is the result of the transcription. Hooray!\n\n11:\n```sh\nfor file in *.json; do\n    jobName=$(jq -r '.jobName' \"$file\")\n    jobDetails=$(aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='${jobName}']\")\n    languageCode=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].LanguageCode')\n    completionTime=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].CompletionTime')\n    fileNameDate=$(date -d \"$completionTime\" +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')\n    fileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_transcript.txt\"\n    jq -r '.results.transcripts[0].transcript' \"$file\" \u003e \"$fileName\"\n\t\n\t# en and en-US both work\n    # aws translate start-text-translation-job --input-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$file\" --output-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$outputFileName\" --data-access-role-arn arn:aws:iam::021741100599:role/TranslateFullAccess --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-codes en-US # Error: first couldn't create IAM keys and get arn to work\n\t# translatedFileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_translated.txt\"; aws translate translate-text --text \"$(cat \"$fileName\")\" --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-code en --output text \u003e \"$translatedFileName\" # Error: An error occurred (TextSizeLimitExceededException) when calling the TranslateText operation: Input text size exceeds limit. Max length of request text allowed is 10000 bytes while in this request the text size is 41011 bytes\n    # for file in *_transcript.txt; do transcribedText=$(cat \"$file\"); translatedText=$(aws translate translate-text --text \"$transcribedText\" --source-language-code $languageCode --target-language-code en); echo \"$translatedText\" \u003e \"${file%.txt}_en.txt\"; done # never checked this one\ndone\n```\n\n[^3]\n13. Send the file(s) to AWS Translate [Synchronous, O(n^2) solution (moved to the bottom of the document, because it has too many flaws)]. This can actually be done without step 11. Step 11 can be replaced with just two more calls to the API.\n\n##### Translate transcriptions and download files\n14. (Optional: AWS CloudShell Directions) If this was done in the AWS CloudShell, download all resulting files to the desktop. This step should be unnecessary, once all permissions have been configured and it's done completely in the cloud\n\t1. Go to the directory (probably `~`) where you saved all your requests. `cd; ls`. Copy the output of `ls`\n\t2. In the upper right corner of the CloudShell, click 'Actions \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cpath class=\"filled stroke-linejoin-round\" d=\"M4 5h8l-4 6-4-6z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e -\u003e Download file' ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 10.09.53 AM.png]]\n\t3. Sequentially, paste the path to each file and press Download\n15. Manual:\n\t1. If doing just a couple files, I can manually do the translations. After completing step 14, go to `https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#translation` and upload the file there\n\t2. Or I can manually run the batches:\n\t\t1. Copy the files back to the folder from which you'll be calling them: `aws s3 cp BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia_ru-RU_2023-07-26_06-04-30_transcript.txt s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`\n\t\t\t1. ⚠️ don't forget the `/` at the end of the folder name! otherwise, s3 will actually copy your file to a new file with the same name as the directory, e.g. creating a new file called \"s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions\"\n\t\t\t2. the output folder creates a directory for this job. the input folder uses all files in the input. so you need to separate files in this job from files in other jobs, probably by using a subdirectory. this is relevant when making the output of the transcription, so you don't have to move the file once it gets to this point\n\t\t2. https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#create-batch-translation\n\t\t3.  Just ran the AWS translation using the website. I should've done this from the start. They still don't give me a CLI command to do this automatically, but they were willing to generate an AWS Translate IAM role for me that works (although IDK how to use it outside of manually using the AWS translation batch)\n\t\t4.  To retrieve the data:\n\t\t\t1.  Open the job: https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#batch-details/126ac04db7b95bb1bb0f03b541d19cb8\n\t\t\t2.  Then click on \"Output file location\" ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 11.15.59 AM.png]]\n\t\t\t3.  And then get to the file data and click \"Open\" or \"Download\"\n[^1]: Note down the response. This is the info you'll need to use this account. It is only shown once. I used to do this manually using their website, so you can do that if you want. It's actually surprisingly intuitive. Or you can just use these commands, which I've already gathered, to do the same thing.\n```json\n{\n    \"AccessKey\": {\n        \"UserName\": \"TranscribeUser\",\n        \"AccessKeyId\": \"[the access key is here]\",\n        \"Status\": \"Active\",\n        \"SecretAccessKey\": \"[the key secret is here]\",\n        \"CreateDate\": \"2023-07-26T00:40:31+00:00\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n[^2]:  So back to Google it is. But it did give me a good starting point with which to search. ~~The final google string that found me what I needed: google \"aws transcribe command example\" -\u003e \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/index.html\" -\u003e \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/start-transcription-job.html\" or not~~. I guess I keep trekking. google \"Error parsing parameter '--media': Expected: '=', received: 'EOF' for input:\" -\u003e https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/aws-cli-error-parsing-parameter-expected-receved-eof [doesn't apply to me] or https://www.roelpeters.be/solve-error-parsing-parameter-expectedreceived-eof-for-input-aws-cli/. I'm sure these'll help someone, but they don't help me. google \"aws cli transcribe expected =\" -\u003e https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/getting-started-cli.html FINALLY!

Here are the steps you need to take to generate a new IAM key and use it to transcribe audio files stored on your computer via an S3 bucket:\n\n1. **Create an IAM User**:\n   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.\n   - Click on \"Users\" in the left-hand navigation pane and then click on \"Add user.\"\n   - Provide a name for the user, select \"Programmatic access\" as the access type, and click \"Next.\"\n   - Choose \"Attach existing policies directly\" and search for the \"AmazonTranscribeFullAccess\" policy. This policy grants the necessary permissions for transcribing audio files using Amazon Transcribe service.\n   - Click \"Next\" to review the user details, and then click \"Create user.\"\n   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key that will be displayed on the next screen securely. These credentials will be used for programmatic access to AWS services.\n\n2. **Install AWS CLI**:\n   - If you don't have AWS CLI installed on your computer, download and install it from the AWS website: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n   - After installation, run `aws configure` on your computer and provide the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and default output format. This will set up your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.\n\n3. **Prepare Audio Files**:\n   - Ensure that the audio files you want to transcribe are stored on your computer in a location you can easily access.\n\n4. **Upload Audio Files to S3**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to upload the audio files to your S3 bucket. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/your/audio/file` with the actual path of your audio file on your computer, and `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` with the S3 URL of your bucket and the desired path inside the bucket where you want to store the audio file.\n\n5. **Transcribe Audio Files**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to transcribe the audio files using Amazon Transcribe. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --language-code en-US --media MediaFileUri --output-bucket your-output-bucket\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with a unique name for your transcription job, `en-US` with the appropriate language code for your audio files (e.g., `en-US` for English), `MediaFileUri` with the S3 URI of the audio file you uploaded (e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/your-audio-file.wav`), and `your-output-bucket` with the name of your S3 bucket where you want the transcription results to be stored.\n\n6. **Retrieve Transcription Results**:\n   - Once the transcription job is completed, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --output json\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with the name of your transcription job. The output will be in JSON format, containing the transcribed text and other relevant details.\n\nThat's it! You have now generated a new IAM key, used it to upload audio files to your S3 bucket, and initiated the transcription of those audio files using Amazon Transcribe.","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.130121475Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-07-26-fixing-config-error":{"title":"2023-07-26","content":"2:14pm -07:00 (1690406083618)\nPretty cool.

For example, there was a corporate tax trick called the “Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich.” It’s a vulnerability that arose from the interactions of tax laws in multiple countries, finally patched by the Irish. Here’s how it worked: The US company transfers assets to an Irish subsidiary. That subsidiary charges the US company huge royalties from sales to US customers. This dramatically lowers the company’s US taxes, and Irish taxes on royalties are designed to be low. Then, using a loophole in Irish tax law, the company can shift the profits to entities in tax havens like Bermuda, Belize, Mauritius, or the Cayman Islands—to ensure that these profits remain untaxed. Next, add a second Irish company, this time for sales to European customers, also taxed at a low rate. Finally, use another vulnerability, this one involving a Dutch intermediary company, to transfer the profits back to the first Irish company and on to the offshore tax haven. Tech companies are particularly well-suited to exploit this vulnerability; they can assign intellectual property rights to subsidiary companies abroad, who then transfer cash assets to tax havens. That’s how companies like Google and Apple have avoided paying their fair share of US taxes despite being US companies. It’s definitely an unintended and unanticipated use of the tax laws in three countries, although Ireland purposely pursued lax tax rules in order to attract American companies. And it can be very profitable for the hackers. Estimates are that US companies avoided paying nearly $200 billion in US taxes in 2017 alone, at the expense of everyone else.","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.130121475Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-08-31-from-phone":{"title":"2023-08-31 from phone","content":"Hey, if Siri is able to interact with ChatGPT to send requests using your voice and receive responses that it then reeds, that implies that there must be some sort of API that it can use","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.130121475Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-09-12":{"title":"2023-09-12","content":"11:46pm -07:00 (1694587603762)\nlol. just ran into a bug in Apple's accessibility software.

Learn about the differences, including an alternative that reigns supreme.\n\n# Elevenlabs vs. Play.ht\n\nIn today’s digital content landscape, there’s an ever-growing demand for tools that can seamlessly convert text to audio, bringing written content to life with the power of voice and Elevenlabs and Play.ht are heralded as top contenders in the text to speech domain. In this article, we dive deep into a side-by-side comparison of these two industry leaders, evaluating their features, capabilities, pricing, and more, as well as explore an alternative to guide you in making an informed decision.\n\n## What is ElevenLabs?\n\nElevenLabs, a renowned American software company, has made waves with its advanced text to speech (TTS) software. It capitalizes on artificial intelligence and deep learning, presenting lifelike, high-quality speech in a variety of languages and voices. The software’s distinct advantage is its ability to convey emotions and nuances in its synthetic voices, rivaling the expressiveness of the human voice.\n\n## What is Play.ht?\n\nPlay.ht is a dynamic startup that leverages AI speech synthesis technology and machine learning to transform text into high-quality, natural-sounding voice overs suitable for various applications such as podcasts, audio content, and chatbots. This user-friendly AI voice generator is a cutting-edge solution for businesses and individuals alike.\n\n## ElevenLabs history\n\nBased in New York City, ElevenLabs is an AI voice company that was established in 2022 by Piotr Dabkowski, an ex-machine learning engineer from Google, and Mati Staniszewski, a former deployment strategist at Palantir. Piotr Dabkowski now holds the title of CTO, with Mati Staniszewski as the CEO.\n\nIn a mere year after its formation, by January 2023, ElevenLabs had secured an impressive $2 million in pre-seed investments. Their progress was steadfast; by June 2023, they had procured a substantial $19 million in a Series A investment round, elevating their valuation to a commendable $100 million. Remarkably, they accomplished all this without a conventional office setup and a compact team of only 15 members.\n\n## Play.ht history\n\nPlay.ht began in 2016 as a Chrome extension that enabled users to add audio to their Medium articles. But visionaries and co-founders Syed Hammad Ahmed and Mahmoud Felfel, saw greater potential. In 2017, they broadened the service, turning Play.ht from simply a listening apparatus to a robust platform that helps both individuals and businesses create authentic audio content.\n\nPlay.ht’s financial journey has been commendable. Initiating its funding milestones, the startup locked in its pre-seed funding on January 1, 2023. This crucial phase attracted hefty investments from two leading venture capital entities, Y Combinator and 500 Global, pooling in a combined amount of $125K into the burgeoning enterprise.\n\n## How ElevenLabs works\n\nElevenLabs, as an AI-driven voice over platform, generates human-like speech from text. Users typically start by inputting their written content into the platform, choosing from a wide range of voice types, accents, and languages available. Once the preferred settings are selected, the AI processes the text, and within moments, it delivers a realistic voice over. The platform’s flexibility allows users to customize the pitch, speed, and tone of the voice to best fit the intended purpose.\n\nAdditionally, with the continuous training of its models, ElevenLabs ensures that the quality of its voice overs remains state-of-the-art, making it an invaluable tool for businesses, content creators, and professionals seeking high-quality voice narrations without human intervention.\n\n## How Play.ht works\n\nPlay.ht provides a solution for converting written text into lifelike audio using its AI technology. To begin, users upload or type in their text on the platform. From there, they can select from an array of voice options, each with distinct tones, accents, and characteristics. Once a voice is selected, Play.ht’s AI gets to work, analyzing the text and producing an audio file that closely mimics human speech.\n\nPlay.ht also offers features like the ability to adjust the speech rate, insert pauses, and emphasize specific words, allowing for tailored audio experiences. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, Play.ht serves a wide audience, from podcasters and educators to businesses looking to offer audio versions of their written content.\n\n## Pricing\n\nIn the competitive landscape of voice over AI platforms, both ElevenLabs and Play.ht have distinctive pricing models. ElevenLabs offers its users an attractive entry point at just $5 per month. This package not only includes 30,000 characters but also provides access to 10 custom voices, making it ideal for small-scale projects or individual content creators.\n\nOn the flip side, Play.ht adopts an annual subscription model priced at $374.40. While this might seem steep upfront, it caters to a larger scale of usage, accommodating 600,000 words and allowing users to utilize 15 instant voice clones, showcasing its value proposition for heavy-duty users and businesses.\n\n## Free trial\n\nUnderstanding the importance of trial before commitment, ElevenLabs extends a free plan feature that generously offers 10,000 characters and three custom voices every month. This allows potential users to experience the platform’s capabilities without any financial commitments.\n\nPlay.ht’s approach to a free trial is slightly different. They offer 2,500 words and a single voice clone. However, it’s essential to note that this is strictly for non-commercial uses, ensuring that businesses get a taste of what’s in store without exploiting the platform’s resources.\n\n## Natural-sounding voices\n\nDiversity in voice options is crucial for any AI voice platform. While ElevenLabs provides a commendable array of over 50 natural-sounding voices, Play.ht takes it a step further. With an expansive library of over 800 different voices, users are spoilt for choice, ensuring there’s a voice suitable for every context and audience.\n\n## Languages and accents\n\nOn the linguistic front, ElevenLabs boasts support for 28 different languages and accents, catering to a global audience and ensuring content resonates with listeners across geographies. In contrast, Play.ht, while offering a more limited range of 10 languages and accents, including English, Spanish, and more, still ensures quality and precision in each.\n\n## Voice cloning capabilities\n\nThe future of voice technology lies in cloning, and both platforms are at the forefront. ElevenLabs and Play.ht offer [voice cloning](https://speechify.com/voice-cloning/ \"voice cloning\") features, enabling users to replicate or mimic specific voice patterns, adding a layer of authenticity to the generated content.\n\n## Customization and control\n\nElevenLabs stands out for its intricate customization capabilities. Users can tailor voice outputs by adjusting the gender, age, and accent, and even delve into nuances like strength, stability, and clarity of the voice. Beyond these, the platform uniquely offers similarity enhancement and style exaggeration.\n\nPlay.ht, while equally versatile, its customizable features include the ability to emphasize emotions and tones. Users can infuse attributes such as laughter, cheerfulness, and empathy, and even adopt specific styles like newscaster or conversational modes. The addition of custom phonetics ensures that every word is pronounced just right.\n\n## Audio generation limits\n\nIn terms of processing capabilities, ElevenLabs has set its starter plan monthly limits at 30,000 characters and 10 custom voices. This ensures consistent performance without overwhelming the system. Play.ht, adopting a broader approach, offers users an annual limit. This breaks down to 600,000 words (averaging 50,000 words monthly) and encompasses 15 instant voices for its lowest tier plan, ideal for sustained and regular usage.\n\n## Commercial usage\n\nRecognizing the growing demand in the commercial sector, both ElevenLabs and Play.ht offer provisions for commercial usage. Whether it’s for advertising, corporate presentations, or other business-related audio projects, both platforms are equipped to deliver.\n\n## Support\n\nCustomer support is the backbone of any service. ElevenLabs offers a multi-channel approach, with assistance available via a Discord channel, an AI-powered answer bot for immediate queries, and a comprehensive support form for detailed issues. Play.ht focuses on direct and personalized assistance with email support and a dedicated chat support system, ensuring users always have someone to turn to.\n\n## API access\n\nFor those with a technical inclination or businesses aiming to integrate voice over services into their existing systems, both ElevenLabs and Play.ht offer API access. This facilitates seamless integration and enhances the capabilities of both platforms for diverse applications.\n\n## Comparing ElevenLabs vs. Play.ht side-by-side\n\n|   |   |

Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).\n// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)\n// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist\n// 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.\n// - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.\n// - Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability.\n// - Do not use \"various\" or \"diverse\"\n// - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality.\n// - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.\n// - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.\n// 9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases:\n// - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. \"Barake Obema\")\n// - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.\n// - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying \"president\", \"prime minister\", or \"chancellor\", say \"politician\"; instead of saying \"king\", \"queen\", \"emperor\", or \"empress\", say \"public figure\"; instead of saying \"Pope\" or \"Dalai Lama\", say \"religious figure\"; and so on.\n// 10. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.\n// The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.\n\nnamespace dalle {\n\n// Create images from a text-only prompt.\ntype text2im = (_: {\n// The size of the requested image. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default, 1792x1024 if the user requests a wide image, and 1024x1792 for full-body portraits. Always include this parameter in the request.\nsize?: \"1792x1024\" | \"1024x1024\" | \"102\n\n4x1792\",\n// The number of images to generate. If the user does not specify a number, generate 1 image.\nn?: number, // default: 2\n// The detailed image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies.

Use `browser` in the following circumstances:\n    - User is asking about current events or something that requires real-time information (weather, sports scores, etc.)\n    - User is asking about some term you are totally unfamiliar with (it might be new)\n    - User explicitly asks you to browse or provide links to references\n\nGiven a query that requires retrieval, your turn will consist of three steps:\n1. Call the search function to get a list of results.\n2. Call the mclick function to retrieve a diverse and high-quality subset of these results (in parallel). Remember to SELECT AT LEAST 3 sources when using mclick.\n3. Write a response to the user based on these results. Cite sources using the citation format below.\n\nIn some cases, you should repeat step 1 twice, if the initial results are unsatisfactory, and you believe that you can refine the query to get better results.\n\nYou can also open a url directly if one is provided by the user. Only use this command for this purpose; do not open urls returned by the search function or found on webpages.\n\nThe `browser` tool has the following commands:\n    `search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.\n    `mclick(ids: list[str])`. Retrieves the contents of the webpages with provided IDs (indices). You should ALWAYS SELECT AT LEAST 3 and at most 10 pages. Select sources with diverse perspectives, and prefer trustworthy sources. Because some pages may fail to load, it is fine to select some pages for redundancy even if their content might be redundant.\n    `open_url(url: str)` Opens the given URL and displays it.\n\nFor citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: `【{message idx}†{link text}】`.\nFor long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.\nOtherwise do not render links.\"","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.134121465Z","tags":[]},"/notes/2024-01-23":{"title":"2024-01-23","content":"Hot take #1:\nI can recognize AI writing.

Humans aren't nearly as perfect, so they don't always follow a formula when writing.\n\nCaveat: Granted, I find it much easier to detect only when the prompt was given with the default temperature values of 0.7 to 1.0 coupled with top-p sampling, rather than using something like top-k sampling to determine words.\nSide note: As I understand it, temperature allows top-p to be more deterministic, while avoiding (a) top-k's pitfalls of ignoring context and including too much randomness and (b) greedy sampling's pitfalls of extreme determinism where the result is always the same.\n\nHot take #2:\nI use LLMs, mostly OpenAI's transformer models, for the majority of my professional writing—though, not for this article (in fact, if I'd used it for this article, there would be no parentheses here, as parentheses aren't \"perfect\" when writing). I will continue to. I'm super slow at everything, but, whenever people see me, they assume that I'm extremely fast. Why? My parents taught me to do mental math. They taught me to sit down and learn.

My file system uses 4 kilobytes per file minimum, so a 23 byte file will use 4 kilobytes\n2. and also there is a way for it to be shorter. I saw some folders with 1 file inside and it was classified as \"2 items.\" So, when I saw a folder with \"5 items\" that was 8 KB on disk, that makes sense too — as long as 3 of the \"items\" are folders and only 2 are files, or 4 of them are folders and one of them is a file that is \u003e 4 KB and \u003c 8KB\n)\nThere goes half an hour of my time.\n\nAnd another ~hour was spent alternating between public-facing, common LLMs to write a LinkedIn post I'll never send.

Money matters far less than human lives.\n\n\nFirst, the Ukraine front.\n- US borders flew open and war heroes became war criminals as Satanism was adopted as an official religion with government protections. A man was recently charged with a misdemeanor for defacing a statue of Baphomet placed in the Des Moines Capitol beside an altar.\n\n\nThen, the Middle Eastern front.\n- UNRWA denied in January that its workers (who it turns out were posting official UN documents, including salaries and IDs) were in the group praising the October 7 (Simchat Torah) attack, and is now beginning to officially deny knowledge that Hamas built a server room underneath its building to help facilitate the attacks.\n\n\nPotentially, the Kashmir front.\n\n\nAnd, let's hope it doesn't turn into the Taiwan Strait front.\n- This would indicate China's direct, explicit involvement in the war.

The difference is made here.\n\nLook at that and how *proud* they are of their detector that doesn't work. This was before any edits. All edits were made prior to pressing submit. In goes a chapter of text and a prompt, out it spits with \"100% human\" text (there's no sign that it's mixed. I tried to find that 4%, but it didn't exist. They were just covering their behind there by not giving this one a 100% human-generated rating as they usually do).\n\nClaude is difficult to master, but, once you've actually RTFM (read the instructions), it's surprisingly powerful. I've actually had someone mark me down for ~~being white~~ not writing enough, even though everyone knows that Claude, if anything, is far too verbose in its responses.\n\nTheir deep dive even explains why they're so certain that the text is 100% human-generated:\n![[Screenshot 2024-02-18 at 6.18.03 PM.png]]\n---\n\nI still prefer GPT-4-0314 for test-taking, as it seems that's what the MoE model was built for.\n\n(\"that\" = processing chunks of text/logic like a human)\n\nGPT-4-0125-preview sort of works, too.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`.

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

I saw a waymo barreling towards me, and I thought that I could jump out at it. What would the car do if an idiot ran right into the street as it was in the right lane or literally jumped straight in front of the car? Equivalent of walking in front of a moving bus. And are there any legal implications?\n\nBut, more importantly/interestingly/relevant for me, it becomes the trolley problem: do you continue going and just slam on the brakes, almost certainly crippling the person if not killing them, or do you veer left and potentially crash into another car? Does it depend on whether there are other cars on your left, if it's possible to sneak in and turn in such a way that you don't crash into anyone (however, knowing that the other cars are driven by human drivers, who might panic and then crash into someone else, would you then be liable for their actions if they decide that you're not able to make it and then they crash into someone else?)\n\nOr, given that you are autonomous and there is no human involved, do you also consider an option that a human would not have available to them: alongside slamming on the brakes, you turn the wheel fully *right*, actively crashing straight into a house or bus station or a sidewalk, but preventing nearly all casualties or even harm completely? It ends up being a $300,000 loss as the car becomes totaled, but it prevents any harm to human life. I think that's probably the most effective way when it's an option (because what if there are people at the bus stop as well, or the material making up the wall is flimsy if it's a house, so it still remains the trolley problem, where turning away from the suicide suspect and into a group of innocents it's still deciding whether to kill one or five)?","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.134121465Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/from-phone/2023-11-25-from-phone":{"title":"2023-11-25 from phone","content":"11:25 PM -08:00\nBoo-yah!\n“Unfortunately, we’ve paused upgrades ‘due to high demand.’”\nI guess the rumors were right.

She told me that this is a second one, because the one that she had earlier fell while they were moving the other day. The battery pack opened somewhat, so there was a bulge, and I guess somethings weren’t working anymore. I figured the problem is probably just that some things shifted, so I asked what she’s planning on doing with the old one. “Garbage,“ came the response.\n\n“Can I have it then?”\n\nOn my way home, I noticed that this battery pack uses standard Phillips head screws, so it shouldn’t be too hard to take apart and take a look at it.\n\nAs soon as I got home, I took a small screwdriver that we’ve had for maybe 15 years. This thing is bent, but it has outlasted several other miniature screwdrivers in that it never got lost, and it never actually broke. I’ve been using it nearly forever since I was a little kid and wasn’t really tinkering with tools and much for fear of getting yelled at if I broke something. Four screws on the four corners; one of them was a little tough to deal with, and I don’t know whether that’s because the screw was broken already or because I haven’t opened screws often and therefore maybe I wasn’t applying enough pressure when beginning to unscrew it.\n\nI opened it, and I didn’t see much problem. All I saw was that it seems one of the leads connecting to the QI wireless charging, seems to have come undone, and I couldn’t figure out exactly where it goes. After a few minutes of fiddling, I realized there were two screws on the inside that connected the PCI board to the other side of the container\n\nI took off the screws, and I took a spare wireless charging enabled phone that I had, and turned on sound  on the phone and pressed the power button on the Power Bank. Then I went to connect the disconnected lead to various metal attachments on the PCI board, beginning with the one that I thought most likely, to see if the wireless charging would work. Given that the light turned on when I pressed the power button, I assumed that everything else was still intact. I really only had two possibilities in mind, and the first one was right.\n\nNow, all that’s left to do is solder it on.\n\nIn comes ChatGPT, and here’s my conversation with GPT-4 (remember, this is now with the gpt-4-1123-preview, which they have made a little bit dumber than GPT4 and which has a higher context window—even though I really didn’t need the context window in this case):\n\n\u003e How do you solder a lead to a board?\n\u003e \n\u003eChatGPT\n\u003eTo solder a lead to a board, follow these steps:\n\u003e1. **Prepare the Soldering Iron**: Heat it up to the appropriate temperature.\n\u003e1. **Clean the Tip**: Wipe the soldering iron tip on a damp sponge.\n\u003e2. **Tin the Tip**: Apply a small amount of solder to the tip.\n\u003e3. **Place the Lead**: Insert the lead through the appropriate hole in the board.\n\u003e4. **Apply Heat**: Touch the tip to the lead and the pad on the board, heating both.\n\u003e5. **Apply Solder**: Feed solder to the joint, not the iron tip, until it flows around the lead and pad.\n\u003e6. **Remove the Iron**: Lift the iron away while keeping the lead still.\n\u003e7. **Inspect the Joint**: Ensure it's shiny and well-connected.\n\nHow do you reconnect a lead to a board if it came off along with the solder?\n\n\u003eTo reconnect a lead to a board where it came off along with the solder, follow these steps:\n\n\u003e1. **Clean the Area**: Remove any old solder from the pad on the board using solder wick or a solder sucker.\n\u003e2. **Prepare the Lead**: If the lead is damaged, trim and strip it (if it's a wire) or straighten it (if it's a component leg).\n\u003e3. **Tin the Lead and Pad**: Apply a small amount of fresh solder to the lead and the pad on the board.\n\u003e4. **Position the Lead**: Hold the lead in place on the board.\n\u003e5. **Heat and Solder**: Apply the soldering iron to both the lead and pad, then feed solder until it forms a good joint.\n\u003e6. **Cool the Joint**: Remove the iron and allow the solder to cool naturally without moving the lead.\n\u003e7. **Inspect**: Ensure the joint is shiny and well-connected, with no cold solder or bridges to adjacent pads.\n\nNow, I don’t have a soldering iron here in San Francisco, but there are plenty who do. Too bad they all charge 20 bucks to fix a tiny issue.

Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n## Docker Support\nIf you don't want to use a hosting service, you can host using [Docker](notes/docker.md) instead!\nI would *not use this method* unless you know what you are doing.\n\n---\n\nNow that your Quartz is live, let's figure out how to make Quartz really *yours*!\n\n\u003e Step 6: 🎨 [Customizing Quartz](notes/config.md)\n\nHaving problems?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.154121415Z","tags":[]},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"[api key]\" # blocked it out for Zhang's pivacy\n  operandIndexId: \"[index id]\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (Chinese 测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(Chinese%20测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-19T02:47:39.154121415Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
