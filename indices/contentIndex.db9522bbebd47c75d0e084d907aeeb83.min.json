Prompted me to finally start this public blog. I'd publish everything on here, but my writing has thoughts that, well, shouldn't be public. Any interactions that could be questionable were always positive interactions from all parties. But my thoughts were not.\n\n10:59am -07:00 (1690307982634)\nRight now, this isn't what anyone is saying, but this is my (hot) take:\nPeople are saying turning Twitter into X is a mistake. I disagree. If I remember right, X.Com was the original name of PayPal, so Musk has a connection to it. Model X and SpaceX are testaments to the same (yes, I know the consumer cars Tesla released spell out SX3Y, an anagram for sexy, but I stand by my conviction that the letter X has a special meaning to the man).\n@elonmusk Musk overpaid for Twitter. The issue for him, the reason that he kept talking about the number of bots and the overplayed, exaggerated bot statistics, was that he was just paying too much for this website. His \"cost per click\"/\"cost per mille\"/cost per consumer was far higher than it should have been. He was buying the company just for their network and their worldwide reach. (of course, their near-instantaneous infrastructure was also good, but it wasn't the most important thing, because he can always hire engineers to replace their infrastructure). The same reason JP Morgan bought Frank.\nBut he's doing everything right. He gets a network, then he links it to X. Eventually, his hope is that X becomes a world-wide payment system, where you think about a car and a Tesla drives up to you and gets you to your destination, and the payment is handled in the background. The idea is there. With my background in neuroscience, I'd like to be on the Neuralink side of things, but I hope that my application will be by manual introduction.","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.811339605Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-07-26":{"title":"2023-07-26 Creating a simple transcription/translation script with AWS","content":"\n### aws file transcription\n\nTL;DR: Still not finished. This tells you how to take an audio file, upload it to AWS (assuming you've already created a bucket[^4]), create a user account (they call it an \"IAM User\") with the necessary permissions, transcribe the file, and then manually submit a batch job to translate it. Translating via terminal/programmatically is a headache that I still haven't figured out. It involves temporary permissions (they call them \"IAM Roles\"), instead of just giving the user account permission. That's all that's remaining for this to be a complete tutorial to automate permissions.\n\n[^4]: either with something like `aws s3 mb recordings` or manually via the website\n\nBonus! I also included a [[2023-07-26 GPT prompt]]\n\n##### Create user to do transcriptions\nRun the following commands in the cloud console (or on your machine which already has access to the AWS CLI. Since I didn't want to bother with downloading and configuring the CLI, I chose the cloud console). To access the console Go to `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users` -\u003e and click on the console button, which looks like this: \u003ca class=\"globalNav-0291 globalNav-029 globalNav-0210 _icon-color_izqbm_6\" href=\"https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1\" title=\"CloudShell\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" id=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-testid=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-tools-experience-ingress-point=\"cloudshell-icon-header\"\u003e\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"2.0\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"globalNav-0216\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M5 5l2.997 2.998L5 11m4.997-.002H12m3-7.626A2.374 2.374 0 0012.627 1H3.37A2.372 2.372 0 001 3.372v9.256a2.373 2.373 0 002.37 2.373h9.257A2.375 2.375 0 0015 12.628V3.372z\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-miterlimit=\"1.5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" fill=\"none\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n1. `aws iam create-user --user-name TranscribeUser`\n2. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`\n3. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonTranscribeFullAccess`\n4. `aws iam create-access-key --user-name TranscribeUser` [^1]\n5. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/TranslateFullAccess` (figured it out by running ~~```export POLICYARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`TranslateFullAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)```~~ `aws iam list-policies` from AWS's [how-to page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-iam-policy.html) and searching through the results)\n\n##### Upload files and run transcription command\n6. Then figure out how to upload the files from my Mac to the S3 bucket programmatically. For now, uploaded manually by opening the [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/upload/recordings.smolkin.org?region=us-west-1)\n\t1. I set this up on EC2 and did this just a couple days ago with the log files, so it can't be too hard to set up on my Mac\n\t2. Here's the command I'll run: `aws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` \n7. When using the AWS CLI, you'll need to handle special characters, such as spaces, by enclosing the S3 URL in double quotes to prevent parsing errors. Well, you should escape the spaces in the S3 URL using backslashes or enclose it in double quotes, if there's an error.[^2] \n8. Transcribe the recordings (can be run inside cloud console as well). \n\t1. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to get GPT-3.5 to generate the command properly for me.[^2] FINALLY! The issue was how `--media` was supposed to be handled: `--media MediaFileUri=s3://{bucket_name}/path/to/file`\n\t2. Update: it's best to put these inside a separate folder that contains nothing from previous days, as all files in this directory will be used when generating the translation. So don't use `recordings.smokin.org/results`, rather use `recordings.smolkin.org/results/transcriptions/{today's date}`\n```\n# Transcribe New Recording 8.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 8.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n# Transcribe New Recording 9.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 9.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n```\n\n##### Retrieve completed transcriptions\n9. List all transcription jobs in your AWS account, including their status, and you can check if the new job with your specified job name has completed successfully: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs`\n\t1. You can also run it with the specific job name: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews']\"`\n10. Once the transcription job is completed (i.e. `TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=={JobName}][\"TranscriptionJobStatus\"] == \"COMPLETED\"`, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results: `aws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --output json`\n11. This part is much better to do once you have that IAM access working (otherwise, accessing files is a huge pain with AWS S3): The transcription results are stored in the S3 bucket and folder/object specified by the `OutputBucketName` and `OutputKey` parameters when the job was created. You can use the `cp` command to copy the transcription file from S3 to the local computer/server: `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews.json ./`, `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia.json ./`\n12. Create a transitional text file that will be used for the automated translation. Also, this is the result of the transcription. Hooray!\n\n11:\n```sh\nfor file in *.json; do\n    jobName=$(jq -r '.jobName' \"$file\")\n    jobDetails=$(aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='${jobName}']\")\n    languageCode=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].LanguageCode')\n    completionTime=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].CompletionTime')\n    fileNameDate=$(date -d \"$completionTime\" +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')\n    fileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_transcript.txt\"\n    jq -r '.results.transcripts[0].transcript' \"$file\" \u003e \"$fileName\"\n\t\n\t# en and en-US both work\n    # aws translate start-text-translation-job --input-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$file\" --output-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$outputFileName\" --data-access-role-arn arn:aws:iam::021741100599:role/TranslateFullAccess --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-codes en-US # Error: first couldn't create IAM keys and get arn to work\n\t# translatedFileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_translated.txt\"; aws translate translate-text --text \"$(cat \"$fileName\")\" --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-code en --output text \u003e \"$translatedFileName\" # Error: An error occurred (TextSizeLimitExceededException) when calling the TranslateText operation: Input text size exceeds limit. Max length of request text allowed is 10000 bytes while in this request the text size is 41011 bytes\n    # for file in *_transcript.txt; do transcribedText=$(cat \"$file\"); translatedText=$(aws translate translate-text --text \"$transcribedText\" --source-language-code $languageCode --target-language-code en); echo \"$translatedText\" \u003e \"${file%.txt}_en.txt\"; done # never checked this one\ndone\n```\n\n[^3]\n13. Send the file(s) to AWS Translate [Synchronous, O(n^2) solution (moved to the bottom of the document, because it has too many flaws)]. This can actually be done without step 11. Step 11 can be replaced with just two more calls to the API.\n\n##### Translate transcriptions and download files\n14. (Optional: AWS CloudShell Directions) If this was done in the AWS CloudShell, download all resulting files to the desktop. This step should be unnecessary, once all permissions have been configured and it's done completely in the cloud\n\t1. Go to the directory (probably `~`) where you saved all your requests. `cd; ls`. Copy the output of `ls`\n\t2. In the upper right corner of the CloudShell, click 'Actions \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cpath class=\"filled stroke-linejoin-round\" d=\"M4 5h8l-4 6-4-6z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e -\u003e Download file' ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 10.09.53 AM.png]]\n\t3. Sequentially, paste the path to each file and press Download\n15. Manual:\n\t1. If doing just a couple files, I can manually do the translations. After completing step 14, go to `https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#translation` and upload the file there\n\t2. Or I can manually run the batches:\n\t\t1. Copy the files back to the folder from which you'll be calling them: `aws s3 cp BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia_ru-RU_2023-07-26_06-04-30_transcript.txt s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`\n\t\t\t1. ⚠️ don't forget the `/` at the end of the folder name! otherwise, s3 will actually copy your file to a new file with the same name as the directory, e.g. creating a new file called \"s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions\"\n\t\t\t2. the output folder creates a directory for this job. the input folder uses all files in the input. so you need to separate files in this job from files in other jobs, probably by using a subdirectory. this is relevant when making the output of the transcription, so you don't have to move the file once it gets to this point\n\t\t2. https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#create-batch-translation\n\t\t3.  Just ran the AWS translation using the website. I should've done this from the start. They still don't give me a CLI command to do this automatically, but they were willing to generate an AWS Translate IAM role for me that works (although IDK how to use it outside of manually using the AWS translation batch)\n\t\t4.  To retrieve the data:\n\t\t\t1.  Open the job: https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#batch-details/126ac04db7b95bb1bb0f03b541d19cb8\n\t\t\t2.  Then click on \"Output file location\" ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 11.15.59 AM.png]]\n\t\t\t3.  And then get to the file data and click \"Open\" or \"Download\"\n[^1]: Note down the response. This is the info you'll need to use this account. It is only shown once. I used to do this manually using their website, so you can do that if you want. It's actually surprisingly intuitive. Or you can just use these commands, which I've already gathered, to do the same thing.\n```json\n{\n    \"AccessKey\": {\n        \"UserName\": \"TranscribeUser\",\n        \"AccessKeyId\": \"[the access key is here]\",\n        \"Status\": \"Active\",\n        \"SecretAccessKey\": \"[the key secret is here]\",\n        \"CreateDate\": \"2023-07-26T00:40:31+00:00\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n[^2]:  So back to Google it is. But it did give me a good starting point with which to search. ~~The final google string that found me what I needed: google \"aws transcribe command example\" -\u003e \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/index.html\" -\u003e \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/start-transcription-job.html\" or not~~. I guess I keep trekking. google \"Error parsing parameter '--media': Expected: '=', received: 'EOF' for input:\" -\u003e https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/aws-cli-error-parsing-parameter-expected-receved-eof [doesn't apply to me] or https://www.roelpeters.be/solve-error-parsing-parameter-expectedreceived-eof-for-input-aws-cli/. I'm sure these'll help someone, but they don't help me. google \"aws cli transcribe expected =\" -\u003e https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/getting-started-cli.html FINALLY!

Here are the steps you need to take to generate a new IAM key and use it to transcribe audio files stored on your computer via an S3 bucket:\n\n1. **Create an IAM User**:\n   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.\n   - Click on \"Users\" in the left-hand navigation pane and then click on \"Add user.\"\n   - Provide a name for the user, select \"Programmatic access\" as the access type, and click \"Next.\"\n   - Choose \"Attach existing policies directly\" and search for the \"AmazonTranscribeFullAccess\" policy. This policy grants the necessary permissions for transcribing audio files using Amazon Transcribe service.\n   - Click \"Next\" to review the user details, and then click \"Create user.\"\n   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key that will be displayed on the next screen securely. These credentials will be used for programmatic access to AWS services.\n\n2. **Install AWS CLI**:\n   - If you don't have AWS CLI installed on your computer, download and install it from the AWS website: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n   - After installation, run `aws configure` on your computer and provide the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and default output format. This will set up your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.\n\n3. **Prepare Audio Files**:\n   - Ensure that the audio files you want to transcribe are stored on your computer in a location you can easily access.\n\n4. **Upload Audio Files to S3**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to upload the audio files to your S3 bucket. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/your/audio/file` with the actual path of your audio file on your computer, and `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` with the S3 URL of your bucket and the desired path inside the bucket where you want to store the audio file.\n\n5. **Transcribe Audio Files**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to transcribe the audio files using Amazon Transcribe. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --language-code en-US --media MediaFileUri --output-bucket your-output-bucket\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with a unique name for your transcription job, `en-US` with the appropriate language code for your audio files (e.g., `en-US` for English), `MediaFileUri` with the S3 URI of the audio file you uploaded (e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/your-audio-file.wav`), and `your-output-bucket` with the name of your S3 bucket where you want the transcription results to be stored.\n\n6. **Retrieve Transcription Results**:\n   - Once the transcription job is completed, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --output json\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with the name of your transcription job. The output will be in JSON format, containing the transcribed text and other relevant details.\n\nThat's it! You have now generated a new IAM key, used it to upload audio files to your S3 bucket, and initiated the transcription of those audio files using Amazon Transcribe.","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.811339605Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-07-26-fixing-config-error":{"title":"2023-07-26","content":"2:14pm -07:00 (1690406083618)\nPretty cool.

For example, there was a corporate tax trick called the “Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich.” It’s a vulnerability that arose from the interactions of tax laws in multiple countries, finally patched by the Irish. Here’s how it worked: The US company transfers assets to an Irish subsidiary. That subsidiary charges the US company huge royalties from sales to US customers. This dramatically lowers the company’s US taxes, and Irish taxes on royalties are designed to be low. Then, using a loophole in Irish tax law, the company can shift the profits to entities in tax havens like Bermuda, Belize, Mauritius, or the Cayman Islands—to ensure that these profits remain untaxed. Next, add a second Irish company, this time for sales to European customers, also taxed at a low rate. Finally, use another vulnerability, this one involving a Dutch intermediary company, to transfer the profits back to the first Irish company and on to the offshore tax haven. Tech companies are particularly well-suited to exploit this vulnerability; they can assign intellectual property rights to subsidiary companies abroad, who then transfer cash assets to tax havens. That’s how companies like Google and Apple have avoided paying their fair share of US taxes despite being US companies. It’s definitely an unintended and unanticipated use of the tax laws in three countries, although Ireland purposely pursued lax tax rules in order to attract American companies. And it can be very profitable for the hackers. Estimates are that US companies avoided paying nearly $200 billion in US taxes in 2017 alone, at the expense of everyone else.","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.811339605Z","tags":[]},"/notes/2023-08-31-from-phone":{"title":"2023-08-31 from phone","content":"Hey, if Siri is able to interact with ChatGPT to send requests using your voice and receive responses that it then reeds, that implies that there must be some sort of API that it can use","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.811339605Z","tags":[]},"/notes/2023-09-12":{"title":"2023-09-12","content":"11:46pm -07:00 (1694587603762)\nlol. just ran into a bug in Apple's accessibility software.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (Chinese 测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(Chinese%20测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.815339759Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

For example, there was a corporate tax trick called the “Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich.” It’s a vulnerability that arose from the interactions of tax laws in multiple countries, finally patched by the Irish. Here’s how it worked: The US company transfers assets to an Irish subsidiary. That subsidiary charges the US company huge royalties from sales to US customers. This dramatically lowers the company’s US taxes, and Irish taxes on royalties are designed to be low. Then, using a loophole in Irish tax law, the company can shift the profits to entities in tax havens like Bermuda, Belize, Mauritius, or the Cayman Islands—to ensure that these profits remain untaxed. Next, add a second Irish company, this time for sales to European customers, also taxed at a low rate. Finally, use another vulnerability, this one involving a Dutch intermediary company, to transfer the profits back to the first Irish company and on to the offshore tax haven. Tech companies are particularly well-suited to exploit this vulnerability; they can assign intellectual property rights to subsidiary companies abroad, who then transfer cash assets to tax havens. That’s how companies like Google and Apple have avoided paying their fair share of US taxes despite being US companies. It’s definitely an unintended and unanticipated use of the tax laws in three countries, although Ireland purposely pursued lax tax rules in order to attract American companies. And it can be very profitable for the hackers. Estimates are that US companies avoided paying nearly $200 billion in US taxes in 2017 alone, at the expense of everyone else.","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.815339759Z","tags":[]},"/notes/from-phone/2023-08-31-from-phone-from-phone-from-phone":{"title":"2023-08-31 from phone from phone from phone","content":"Hey, if Siri is able to interact with ChatGPT to send requests using your voice and receive responses that it then reeds, that implies that there must be some sort of API that it can use","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.815339759Z","tags":[]},"/notes/from-phone/2023-09-12-from-phone":{"title":"2023-09-12 from phone","content":"How can I short credit card debt?

I saw a waymo barreling towards me, and I thought that I could jump out at it. What would the car do if an idiot ran right into the street as it was in the right lane or literally jumped straight in front of the car? Equivalent of walking in front of a moving bus. And are there any legal implications?\n\nBut, more importantly/interestingly/relevant for me, it becomes the trolley problem: do you continue going and just slam on the brakes, almost certainly crippling the person if not killing them, or do you veer left and potentially crash into another car? Does it depend on whether there are other cars on your left, if it's possible to sneak in and turn in such a way that you don't crash into anyone (however, knowing that the other cars are driven by human drivers, who might panic and then crash into someone else, would you then be liable for their actions if they decide that you're not able to make it and then they crash into someone else?)\n\nOr, given that you are autonomous and there is no human involved, do you also consider an option that a human would not have available to them: alongside slamming on the brakes, you turn the wheel fully *right*, actively crashing straight into a house or bus station or a sidewalk, but preventing nearly all casualties or even harm completely? It ends up being a $300,000 loss as the car becomes totaled, but it prevents any harm to human life. I think that's probably the most effective way when it's an option (because what if there are people at the bus stop as well, or the material making up the wall is flimsy if it's a house, so it still remains the trolley problem, where turning away from the suicide suspect and into a group of innocents it's still deciding whether to kill one or five)?","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.815339759Z","tags":[]},"/notes/from-phone/fake_file-from-phone-from-phone":{"title":"fake_file from phone from phone","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.815339759Z","tags":[]},"/notes/from-phone/fake_file-from-phone-from-phone-from-phone":{"title":"fake_file from phone from phone from phone","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.815339759Z","tags":[]},"/notes/hello-world":{"title":"hello world","content":"2023-07-25 12:50 pm\tCreating my first file inside Hugo-based Quartz\n\n2023-07-25 15:15 pm\tIt's now ready for publication\n\n2023-07-25 15:40 pm\tIn theory, I should update the languages to include Russian and English and Hebrew and French (and update the corresponding titles)\nhttps://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/\nhttps://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages\nIn practice, I'll probably never get around to adding any languages other than English, and *that's okay*.\n\n---\n\n2023-07-26 16:51 pm\nWow that's awsome:\n\n```goat\n      .               .                .               .--- 1          .-- 1     / 1\n     / \\              |                |           .---+            .-+         +\n    /   \\         .---+---.         .--+--.        |   '--- 2      |   '-- 2   / \\ 2\n   +     +        |       |        |       |    ---+            ---+          +\n  / \\   / \\     .-+-.   .-+-.     .+.     .+.      |   .--- 3      |   .-- 3   \\ / 3\n /   \\ /   \\    |   |   |   |    |   |   |   |     '---+            '-+         +\n 1   2 3   4    1   2   3   4    1   2   3   4         '--- 4          '-- 4     \\ 4\n\n```\n\nOh, that's even cooler:\n````text\nHi\n```json\n{\n\"a\" : \"b\"\n}\n```\n`cd ..`\n``echo \"Hey, what's up?\"``\n```python\nprint(\"Wow, you can make text blocks that cover inner code blocks.\")\n```\n````\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.815339759Z","tags":[]},"/notes/hosting":{"title":"Deploying Quartz to the Web","content":"\n## Hosting on GitHub Pages\nQuartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (Chinese 测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(Chinese%20测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-27T19:22:59.827340223Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
