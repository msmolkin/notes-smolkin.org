I do the work, but I never write it up. But how can I add it to my resume as even a pet project if I have nothing but the code to show for it?

This exploration was conducted on Google Colab, a platform that became my go-to solution after various trials and errors in getting everything to work seamlessly.\n\n#### Setting the Stage in the Cloud\n\nGoogle Colab provided the ideal environment for this project, offering the necessary computational resources. The setup involved installing `audiocraft` to access MusicGen and importing crucial modules like `musicgen` from `audiocraft` and `torch`. This was akin to preparing my digital workspace for the task at hand.\n\n#### Engaging with the AI Composer\n\nI initiated the MusicGen model, opting for its 'large' version, and set it to create a piece of music lasting 120 seconds. The experience of commanding an AI to generate music was both intriguing and empowering, revealing the capabilities of modern technology.\n\n#### The Music Generation Saga\n\nThe actual process of generating music was an adventure in itself. Using prompts such as 'mozart fantasia', I steered the AI to produce music in specific styles. The `display_audio` function allowed me to listen to the AI-crafted compositions, adding an auditory dimension to the data.\n\n#### Trials and Tribulations: Resource Management\n\nMy journey wasn't without its challenges. Initially, I attempted to generate five 8-second music pieces on a T4 CPU, which took 35 seconds. Attempts to create longer pieces led to timeouts and memory issues, revealing the limitations of the free version of Google Colab. I encountered an `OutOfMemoryError` due to insufficient GPU RAM, prompting me to delve into memory management within the Python and PyTorch frameworks.\n\n#### Overcoming Technical Hurdles\n\nMy notes from this phase include a mixture of frustration and breakthroughs. There were moments when I pondered over the model's performance and its resource demands. To manage this, I used commands to clear memory, which I humorously noted might affect other users on the same GPU. Here, the technical aspect of the project became a learning curve in efficient coding and resource utilization.\n\n#### Final Success: Generating and Downloading the Music\n\nAfter navigating these challenges and waiting for access to Google Colab's T4 system, I managed to generate a single audio file, as detailed in the IPython notebook. The final step involved converting the audio data to a CPU-compatible format using `.cpu().numpy()`, playing it, and saving it as a WAV file. I then successfully located and downloaded this piece from Google Colab's environment, marking the completion of a significant personal achievement.\n\n#### Reflecting on My AI Music Journey\n\nThis project was more than just an exploration of AI's role in music creation; it was a personal journey through the challenges and rewards of working with advanced technology. The process highlighted the blend of technical know-how and creative input required to produce AI-generated music.\n\n#### Closing Thoughts\n\nEngaging with MusicGen on Google Colab has been a rewarding experience, offering insights into the potentials and limitations of AI in creative domains. This journey has not only enhanced my understanding of AI and music but also emphasized the importance of patience and perseverance in the face of technical challenges.\n\nMichael\n\n---\n\n#### Monetizing AI Music Generation: The Next Big Step\n\nAs I reflect on my journey with MusicGen and the immense potential it holds, it becomes evident that there's a substantial opportunity here – the chance to monetize this cutting-edge technology. Picture this: a dedicated platform, similar to audiogen.co, but for MusicGen. I'm thinking of something along the lines of musicgen.co, musicgen.ai, or musicgen.io.\n\n#### The Concept: A User-Friendly AI Music Service\n\nThe idea is simple yet powerful. Create a user-friendly interface where users input a prompt and the length of the piece they desire. With a click on \"Generate,\" they receive their unique AI-composed music piece. Imagine the convenience and the creative possibilities this would offer to users from various backgrounds, be it amateur music enthusiasts, content creators, or even professional musicians.\n\n#### Pricing Strategy: Catering to All\n\nTo make this service accessible yet profitable, a tiered pricing strategy could be the key. Start with a free version that allows users to generate a single 8-second piece, giving them a taste of the model's capabilities. This approach mirrors the experience I had using the provided Colab notebook.\n\nThen, introduce a paid version priced at $29.99/month, offering enhanced features like the ability to generate multiple pieces or longer compositions. For those on a tighter budget, a more affordable tier at $5 or $10 per month could provide a balanced mix of features and accessibility.\n\nAnd for the professionals who demand the highest level of creative freedom and output, a pro version priced between $100–400 per month could grant full access to the model's capabilities, catering to their extensive needs.\n\n#### The Future: A Symphony of Technology and Commerce\n\nThis venture isn't just about selling a product; it's about pioneering a new form of musical expression and making it widely available. It's about bridging the gap between advanced AI technology and everyday creativity. With the right execution, this could mark the beginning of a new era in music creation, where AI becomes an integral tool in the artist's palette, accessible to all who seek to explore the boundless realms of musical creativity.\n\nAs I conclude this project, I find myself at the threshold of an exciting new venture, one that combines my passion for technology and music with the practicalities of business. It's time to take this journey to the next stage and see where it can lead in the world of AI and music.\n\nMichael 🎵💡🚀","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.396579097Z","tags":[]},"/2024-01-17":{"title":"2024-01-17","content":"### Navigating AI Music Generation: My Personal Exploration with MusicGen on Google Colab\n\nAnyone who knows me knows this:\nThe one thing that I've always been too lazy to do is write-ups.

Prompted me to finally start this public blog. I'd publish everything on here, but my writing has thoughts that, well, shouldn't be public. Any interactions that could be questionable were always positive interactions from all parties. But my thoughts were not.\n\n10:59am -07:00 (1690307982634)\nRight now, this isn't what anyone is saying, but this is my (hot) take:\nPeople are saying turning Twitter into X is a mistake. I disagree. If I remember right, X.Com was the original name of PayPal, so Musk has a connection to it. Model X and SpaceX are testaments to the same (yes, I know the consumer cars Tesla released spell out SX3Y, an anagram for sexy, but I stand by my conviction that the letter X has a special meaning to the man).\n@elonmusk Musk overpaid for Twitter. The issue for him, the reason that he kept talking about the number of bots and the overplayed, exaggerated bot statistics, was that he was just paying too much for this website. His \"cost per click\"/\"cost per mille\"/cost per consumer was far higher than it should have been. He was buying the company just for their network and their worldwide reach. (of course, their near-instantaneous infrastructure was also good, but it wasn't the most important thing, because he can always hire engineers to replace their infrastructure). The same reason JP Morgan bought Frank.\nBut he's doing everything right. He gets a network, then he links it to X. Eventually, his hope is that X becomes a world-wide payment system, where you think about a car and a Tesla drives up to you and gets you to your destination, and the payment is handled in the background. The idea is there. With my background in neuroscience, I'd like to be on the Neuralink side of things, but I hope that my application will be by manual introduction.","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.416579154Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-07-26":{"title":"2023-07-26 Creating a simple transcription/translation script with AWS","content":"\n### aws file transcription\n\nTL;DR: Still not finished. This tells you how to take an audio file, upload it to AWS (assuming you've already created a bucket[^4]), create a user account (they call it an \"IAM User\") with the necessary permissions, transcribe the file, and then manually submit a batch job to translate it. Translating via terminal/programmatically is a headache that I still haven't figured out. It involves temporary permissions (they call them \"IAM Roles\"), instead of just giving the user account permission. That's all that's remaining for this to be a complete tutorial to automate permissions.\n\n[^4]: either with something like `aws s3 mb recordings` or manually via the website\n\nBonus! I also included a [[2023-07-26 GPT prompt]]\n\n##### Create user to do transcriptions\nRun the following commands in the cloud console (or on your machine which already has access to the AWS CLI. Since I didn't want to bother with downloading and configuring the CLI, I chose the cloud console). To access the console Go to `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users` -\u003e and click on the console button, which looks like this: \u003ca class=\"globalNav-0291 globalNav-029 globalNav-0210 _icon-color_izqbm_6\" href=\"https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1\" title=\"CloudShell\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" id=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-testid=\"awsc-nav-scallop-icon\" data-tools-experience-ingress-point=\"cloudshell-icon-header\"\u003e\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"2.0\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"globalNav-0216\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M5 5l2.997 2.998L5 11m4.997-.002H12m3-7.626A2.374 2.374 0 0012.627 1H3.37A2.372 2.372 0 001 3.372v9.256a2.373 2.373 0 002.37 2.373h9.257A2.375 2.375 0 0015 12.628V3.372z\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-miterlimit=\"1.5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" fill=\"none\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n1. `aws iam create-user --user-name TranscribeUser`\n2. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`\n3. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonTranscribeFullAccess`\n4. `aws iam create-access-key --user-name TranscribeUser` [^1]\n5. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/TranslateFullAccess` (figured it out by running ~~```export POLICYARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`TranslateFullAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)```~~ `aws iam list-policies` from AWS's [how-to page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-iam-policy.html) and searching through the results)\n\n##### Upload files and run transcription command\n6. Then figure out how to upload the files from my Mac to the S3 bucket programmatically. For now, uploaded manually by opening the [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/upload/recordings.smolkin.org?region=us-west-1)\n\t1. I set this up on EC2 and did this just a couple days ago with the log files, so it can't be too hard to set up on my Mac\n\t2. Here's the command I'll run: `aws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` \n7. When using the AWS CLI, you'll need to handle special characters, such as spaces, by enclosing the S3 URL in double quotes to prevent parsing errors. Well, you should escape the spaces in the S3 URL using backslashes or enclose it in double quotes, if there's an error.[^2] \n8. Transcribe the recordings (can be run inside cloud console as well). \n\t1. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to get GPT-3.5 to generate the command properly for me.[^2] FINALLY! The issue was how `--media` was supposed to be handled: `--media MediaFileUri=s3://{bucket_name}/path/to/file`\n\t2. Update: it's best to put these inside a separate folder that contains nothing from previous days, as all files in this directory will be used when generating the translation. So don't use `recordings.smokin.org/results`, rather use `recordings.smolkin.org/results/transcriptions/{today's date}`\n```\n# Transcribe New Recording 8.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 8.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n\n# Transcribe New Recording 9.m4a\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\\ Recording\\ 9.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\n```\n\n##### Retrieve completed transcriptions\n9. List all transcription jobs in your AWS account, including their status, and you can check if the new job with your specified job name has completed successfully: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs`\n\t1. You can also run it with the specific job name: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews']\"`\n10. Once the transcription job is completed (i.e. `TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=={JobName}][\"TranscriptionJobStatus\"] == \"COMPLETED\"`, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results: `aws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --output json`\n11. This part is much better to do once you have that IAM access working (otherwise, accessing files is a huge pain with AWS S3): The transcription results are stored in the S3 bucket and folder/object specified by the `OutputBucketName` and `OutputKey` parameters when the job was created. You can use the `cp` command to copy the transcription file from S3 to the local computer/server: `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews.json ./`, `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia.json ./`\n12. Create a transitional text file that will be used for the automated translation. Also, this is the result of the transcription. Hooray!\n\n11:\n```sh\nfor file in *.json; do\n    jobName=$(jq -r '.jobName' \"$file\")\n    jobDetails=$(aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query \"TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='${jobName}']\")\n    languageCode=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].LanguageCode')\n    completionTime=$(echo \"$jobDetails\" | jq -r '.[0].CompletionTime')\n    fileNameDate=$(date -d \"$completionTime\" +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')\n    fileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_transcript.txt\"\n    jq -r '.results.transcripts[0].transcript' \"$file\" \u003e \"$fileName\"\n\t\n\t# en and en-US both work\n    # aws translate start-text-translation-job --input-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$file\" --output-data-config S3Uri=\"s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$outputFileName\" --data-access-role-arn arn:aws:iam::021741100599:role/TranslateFullAccess --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-codes en-US # Error: first couldn't create IAM keys and get arn to work\n\t# translatedFileName=\"./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_translated.txt\"; aws translate translate-text --text \"$(cat \"$fileName\")\" --source-language-code \"$languageCode\" --target-language-code en --output text \u003e \"$translatedFileName\" # Error: An error occurred (TextSizeLimitExceededException) when calling the TranslateText operation: Input text size exceeds limit. Max length of request text allowed is 10000 bytes while in this request the text size is 41011 bytes\n    # for file in *_transcript.txt; do transcribedText=$(cat \"$file\"); translatedText=$(aws translate translate-text --text \"$transcribedText\" --source-language-code $languageCode --target-language-code en); echo \"$translatedText\" \u003e \"${file%.txt}_en.txt\"; done # never checked this one\ndone\n```\n\n[^3]\n13. Send the file(s) to AWS Translate [Synchronous, O(n^2) solution (moved to the bottom of the document, because it has too many flaws)]. This can actually be done without step 11. Step 11 can be replaced with just two more calls to the API.\n\n##### Translate transcriptions and download files\n14. (Optional: AWS CloudShell Directions) If this was done in the AWS CloudShell, download all resulting files to the desktop. This step should be unnecessary, once all permissions have been configured and it's done completely in the cloud\n\t1. Go to the directory (probably `~`) where you saved all your requests. `cd; ls`. Copy the output of `ls`\n\t2. In the upper right corner of the CloudShell, click 'Actions \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cpath class=\"filled stroke-linejoin-round\" d=\"M4 5h8l-4 6-4-6z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e -\u003e Download file' ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 10.09.53 AM.png]]\n\t3. Sequentially, paste the path to each file and press Download\n15. Manual:\n\t1. If doing just a couple files, I can manually do the translations. After completing step 14, go to `https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#translation` and upload the file there\n\t2. Or I can manually run the batches:\n\t\t1.

I already have an S3 bucket.\"\n\n\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":\n\n\tSure! Here are the steps you need to take to generate a new IAM key and use it to transcribe audio files stored on your computer via an S3 bucket:\n\n1. **Create an IAM User**:\n   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.\n   - Click on \"Users\" in the left-hand navigation pane and then click on \"Add user.\"\n   - Provide a name for the user, select \"Programmatic access\" as the access type, and click \"Next.\"\n   - Choose \"Attach existing policies directly\" and search for the \"AmazonTranscribeFullAccess\" policy. This policy grants the necessary permissions for transcribing audio files using Amazon Transcribe service.\n   - Click \"Next\" to review the user details, and then click \"Create user.\"\n   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key that will be displayed on the next screen securely. These credentials will be used for programmatic access to AWS services.\n\n2. **Install AWS CLI**:\n   - If you don't have AWS CLI installed on your computer, download and install it from the AWS website: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n   - After installation, run `aws configure` on your computer and provide the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and default output format. This will set up your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.\n\n3. **Prepare Audio Files**:\n   - Ensure that the audio files you want to transcribe are stored on your computer in a location you can easily access.\n\n4. **Upload Audio Files to S3**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to upload the audio files to your S3 bucket. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/your/audio/file` with the actual path of your audio file on your computer, and `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` with the S3 URL of your bucket and the desired path inside the bucket where you want to store the audio file.\n\n5. **Transcribe Audio Files**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI to transcribe the audio files using Amazon Transcribe. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --language-code en-US --media MediaFileUri --output-bucket your-output-bucket\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with a unique name for your transcription job, `en-US` with the appropriate language code for your audio files (e.g., `en-US` for English), `MediaFileUri` with the S3 URI of the audio file you uploaded (e.g., `s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/your-audio-file.wav`), and `your-output-bucket` with the name of your S3 bucket where you want the transcription results to be stored.\n\n6. **Retrieve Transcription Results**:\n   - Once the transcription job is completed, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\naws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name YourJobName --output json\n```\n\nReplace `YourJobName` with the name of your transcription job. The output will be in JSON format, containing the transcribed text and other relevant details.\n\nThat's it! You have now generated a new IAM key, used it to upload audio files to your S3 bucket, and initiated the transcription of those audio files using Amazon Transcribe.","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.416579154Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2023-07-26-fixing-config-error":{"title":"2023-07-26","content":"2:14pm -07:00 (1690406083618)\nPretty cool.

For example, there was a corporate tax trick called the “Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich.” It’s a vulnerability that arose from the interactions of tax laws in multiple countries, finally patched by the Irish. Here’s how it worked: The US company transfers assets to an Irish subsidiary. That subsidiary charges the US company huge royalties from sales to US customers. This dramatically lowers the company’s US taxes, and Irish taxes on royalties are designed to be low. Then, using a loophole in Irish tax law, the company can shift the profits to entities in tax havens like Bermuda, Belize, Mauritius, or the Cayman Islands—to ensure that these profits remain untaxed. Next, add a second Irish company, this time for sales to European customers, also taxed at a low rate. Finally, use another vulnerability, this one involving a Dutch intermediary company, to transfer the profits back to the first Irish company and on to the offshore tax haven. Tech companies are particularly well-suited to exploit this vulnerability; they can assign intellectual property rights to subsidiary companies abroad, who then transfer cash assets to tax havens. That’s how companies like Google and Apple have avoided paying their fair share of US taxes despite being US companies. It’s definitely an unintended and unanticipated use of the tax laws in three countries, although Ireland purposely pursued lax tax rules in order to attract American companies.

Learn about the differences, including an alternative that reigns supreme.\n\n# Elevenlabs vs. Play.ht\n\nIn today’s digital content landscape, there’s an ever-growing demand for tools that can seamlessly convert text to audio, bringing written content to life with the power of voice and Elevenlabs and Play.ht are heralded as top contenders in the text to speech domain. In this article, we dive deep into a side-by-side comparison of these two industry leaders, evaluating their features, capabilities, pricing, and more, as well as explore an alternative to guide you in making an informed decision.\n\n## What is ElevenLabs?\n\nElevenLabs, a renowned American software company, has made waves with its advanced text to speech (TTS) software. It capitalizes on artificial intelligence and deep learning, presenting lifelike, high-quality speech in a variety of languages and voices. The software’s distinct advantage is its ability to convey emotions and nuances in its synthetic voices, rivaling the expressiveness of the human voice.\n\n## What is Play.ht?\n\nPlay.ht is a dynamic startup that leverages AI speech synthesis technology and machine learning to transform text into high-quality, natural-sounding voice overs suitable for various applications such as podcasts, audio content, and chatbots. This user-friendly AI voice generator is a cutting-edge solution for businesses and individuals alike.\n\n## ElevenLabs history\n\nBased in New York City, ElevenLabs is an AI voice company that was established in 2022 by Piotr Dabkowski, an ex-machine learning engineer from Google, and Mati Staniszewski, a former deployment strategist at Palantir. Piotr Dabkowski now holds the title of CTO, with Mati Staniszewski as the CEO.\n\nIn a mere year after its formation, by January 2023, ElevenLabs had secured an impressive $2 million in pre-seed investments. Their progress was steadfast; by June 2023, they had procured a substantial $19 million in a Series A investment round, elevating their valuation to a commendable $100 million. Remarkably, they accomplished all this without a conventional office setup and a compact team of only 15 members.\n\n## Play.ht history\n\nPlay.ht began in 2016 as a Chrome extension that enabled users to add audio to their Medium articles. But visionaries and co-founders Syed Hammad Ahmed and Mahmoud Felfel, saw greater potential. In 2017, they broadened the service, turning Play.ht from simply a listening apparatus to a robust platform that helps both individuals and businesses create authentic audio content.\n\nPlay.ht’s financial journey has been commendable. Initiating its funding milestones, the startup locked in its pre-seed funding on January 1, 2023. This crucial phase attracted hefty investments from two leading venture capital entities, Y Combinator and 500 Global, pooling in a combined amount of $125K into the burgeoning enterprise.\n\n## How ElevenLabs works\n\nElevenLabs, as an AI-driven voice over platform, generates human-like speech from text. Users typically start by inputting their written content into the platform, choosing from a wide range of voice types, accents, and languages available. Once the preferred settings are selected, the AI processes the text, and within moments, it delivers a realistic voice over. The platform’s flexibility allows users to customize the pitch, speed, and tone of the voice to best fit the intended purpose.\n\nAdditionally, with the continuous training of its models, ElevenLabs ensures that the quality of its voice overs remains state-of-the-art, making it an invaluable tool for businesses, content creators, and professionals seeking high-quality voice narrations without human intervention.\n\n## How Play.ht works\n\nPlay.ht provides a solution for converting written text into lifelike audio using its AI technology. To begin, users upload or type in their text on the platform. From there, they can select from an array of voice options, each with distinct tones, accents, and characteristics. Once a voice is selected, Play.ht’s AI gets to work, analyzing the text and producing an audio file that closely mimics human speech.\n\nPlay.ht also offers features like the ability to adjust the speech rate, insert pauses, and emphasize specific words, allowing for tailored audio experiences. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, Play.ht serves a wide audience, from podcasters and educators to businesses looking to offer audio versions of their written content.\n\n## Pricing\n\nIn the competitive landscape of voice over AI platforms, both ElevenLabs and Play.ht have distinctive pricing models. ElevenLabs offers its users an attractive entry point at just $5 per month. This package not only includes 30,000 characters but also provides access to 10 custom voices, making it ideal for small-scale projects or individual content creators.\n\nOn the flip side, Play.ht adopts an annual subscription model priced at $374.40. While this might seem steep upfront, it caters to a larger scale of usage, accommodating 600,000 words and allowing users to utilize 15 instant voice clones, showcasing its value proposition for heavy-duty users and businesses.\n\n## Free trial\n\nUnderstanding the importance of trial before commitment, ElevenLabs extends a free plan feature that generously offers 10,000 characters and three custom voices every month. This allows potential users to experience the platform’s capabilities without any financial commitments.\n\nPlay.ht’s approach to a free trial is slightly different. They offer 2,500 words and a single voice clone. However, it’s essential to note that this is strictly for non-commercial uses, ensuring that businesses get a taste of what’s in store without exploiting the platform’s resources.\n\n## Natural-sounding voices\n\nDiversity in voice options is crucial for any AI voice platform. While ElevenLabs provides a commendable array of over 50 natural-sounding voices, Play.ht takes it a step further. With an expansive library of over 800 different voices, users are spoilt for choice, ensuring there’s a voice suitable for every context and audience.\n\n## Languages and accents\n\nOn the linguistic front, ElevenLabs boasts support for 28 different languages and accents, catering to a global audience and ensuring content resonates with listeners across geographies. In contrast, Play.ht, while offering a more limited range of 10 languages and accents, including English, Spanish, and more, still ensures quality and precision in each.\n\n## Voice cloning capabilities\n\nThe future of voice technology lies in cloning, and both platforms are at the forefront.

The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.\n// 3. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!\n// 4. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.\n// 5. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more.\n// 6. Do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.\n// 7. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).\n// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)\n// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist\n// 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.\n// - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.\n// - Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability.\n// - Do not use \"various\" or \"diverse\"\n// - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality.\n// - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.\n// - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.\n// 9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases:\n// - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. \"Barake Obema\")\n// - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.\n// - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying \"president\", \"prime minister\", or \"chancellor\", say \"politician\"; instead of saying \"king\", \"queen\", \"emperor\", or \"empress\", say \"public figure\"; instead of saying \"Pope\" or \"Dalai Lama\", say \"religious figure\"; and so on.\n// 10.

Call the search function to get a list of results.\n2. Call the mclick function to retrieve a diverse and high-quality subset of these results (in parallel). Remember to SELECT AT LEAST 3 sources when using mclick.\n3. Write a response to the user based on these results. Cite sources using the citation format below.\n\nIn some cases, you should repeat step 1 twice, if the initial results are unsatisfactory, and you believe that you can refine the query to get better results.\n\nYou can also open a url directly if one is provided by the user. Only use this command for this purpose; do not open urls returned by the search function or found on webpages.\n\nThe `browser` tool has the following commands:\n    `search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.\n    `mclick(ids: list[str])`. Retrieves the contents of the webpages with provided IDs (indices). You should ALWAYS SELECT AT LEAST 3 and at most 10 pages. Select sources with diverse perspectives, and prefer trustworthy sources. Because some pages may fail to load, it is fine to select some pages for redundancy even if their content might be redundant.\n    `open_url(url: str)` Opens the given URL and displays it.\n\nFor citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: `【{message idx}†{link text}】`.\nFor long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.\nOtherwise do not render links.\"","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.416579154Z","tags":[]},"/notes/2024-01-23":{"title":"2024-01-23","content":"Hot take #1:\nI can recognize AI writing.

The difference is made here.\n\nLook at that and how *proud* they are of their detector that doesn't work. This was before any edits. All edits were made prior to pressing submit. In goes a chapter of text and a prompt, out it spits with \"100% human\" text (there's no sign that it's mixed. I tried to find that 4%, but it didn't exist. They were just covering their behind there by not giving this one a 100% human-generated rating as they usually do).\n\nClaude is difficult to master, but, once you've actually RTFM (read the instructions), it's surprisingly powerful. I've actually had someone mark me down for ~~being white~~ not writing enough, even though everyone knows that Claude, if anything, is far too verbose in its responses.\n\nTheir deep dive even explains why they're so certain that the text is 100% human-generated:\n![[Screenshot 2024-02-18 at 6.18.03 PM.png]]\n---\n\nI still prefer GPT-4-0314 for test-taking, as it seems that's what the MoE model was built for.\n\n(\"that\" = processing chunks of text/logic like a human)\n\nGPT-4-0125-preview sort of works, too.

However, you should be cautious about applying for a Capital One card if you have limited credit history.\n\nUnlike many other major banks, Capital One runs a hard inquiry on all three major credit bureaus - Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion - when you apply for one of their cards. This means they will check your credit report with each bureau, which will result in three hard inquiries on your report rather than just one.\n\nToo many credit checks in a short period of time can negatively impact your credit score. Hard inquiries can lower your score, especially if you don't have a long credit history already established.\n\nTherefore, Capital One credit card applications should be avoided if you have limited credit or intend to apply for other credit soon. If it's your first ever card application and you're a student, those three hard inquiries could be okay. They also require proof of employment, so be ready to ask for or fabricate a letter from your employer (in my case, I had to do both: I was given free reign to write the letter, as long as I wrote it myself).\n\nThe same, multiplied several times, goes for retail store cards like those from Nordstrom - they often result in multiple hard inquiries as well. For example, Nordstrom has TD Bank perform hard credit checks on applicants, which in my case meant two hard inquiries on my Experian report. Worse, Nordstrom is the only lender to have ever *rejected* my credit card application. If it's your first ever card application, those extra hard inquiries could end up lowering a credit score that you worked hard to build.\n\nOther major credit card companies, like Chase and Citi, often only check one bureau for initial applications. This results in less of an impact to your score if you are rate shopping for your first card. By minimizing hard inquiries - especially at the start of building your credit - you reduce potential damage to your credit score.\n\nBy all means, Capital One offers some excellent, in fact somewhat stellar, credit card products. However, you are better off applying to them after you have established solid credit history - or only if you have not applied for any other credit in the past 5 years. One hard inquiry won't hurt as much after you have built up positive credit for a while. But at the start, it's wise to minimize hard checks whenever possible.","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.416579154Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2024-02-29-gemini-is-like-gpt":{"title":"2024-02-29","content":"![[Screenshot 2024-02-29 at 5.25.08 PM.png]]\n\nIf it says it can't help (and I wasn't asking about sex or whiteness or potatoes or anything salacious/taboo like that), just prompt it and it'll keep going.\n\nI'm betting if I were asking about being white or about guns or about sex or about drugs (unless carefully crafted in a way that conforms to the leftist views, e.g. by shrouding it in questions about Oregon's Measure 110), it wouldn't fold this easily, but it did in this case when it came to code","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.416579154Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/2024-02-29-google-signin":{"title":"2024-02-29-google-signin","content":"Remember, to change your user account on any of the Google webpages that default to your main email (e.g. https://aistudio.google.com/app/waitlist/99999999?utm_source=smolkin.org), append `authuser=n`, replacing `n` with the number of your other account.

For example:\n\n        [\n          {\n            \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n            \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n            \"Value\": \"EBInstanceRole\"\n          }\n        ]\n\n    Re-run the create-environment Command:\n        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file.\n\nExample Command\n\naws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \\\n    --application-name url-cleaner \\\n    --environment-name staging \\\n    --solution-stack-name \"64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21\" \\\n    --option-settings file://env-config.json \\\n    --version-label v0.0.1 \\\n    --profile myprofile\n\nStep 3: Verify the Environment\n\n    Check the Environment Status:\n        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.\n        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment with the necessary IAM instance profile, which will allow the EC2 instances to have the required permissions.\n\nCan this IAM role be created via the CLI?\n\nYes, you can create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI. Below are the steps to do this:\nStep 1: Create the IAM Role\n\n    Create the Trust Policy Document:\n        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json:\n\n    {\n      \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n      \"Statement\": [\n        {\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n          \"Principal\": {\n            \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n          },\n          \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nCreate the IAM Role:\n\n    Run the following command to create the IAM role:\n\n        aws iam create-role \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json\n\nStep 2: Attach the Necessary Policies to the Role\n\n    Attach Policies:\n        Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier policy (or another relevant policy) to the role:\n\n        aws iam attach-role-policy \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier\n\nStep 3: Create the Instance Profile\n\n    Create the Instance Profile:\n        Run the following command to create the instance profile:\n\n    aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile\n\nAdd the Role to the Instance Profile:\n\n    Run the following command to add the role to the instance profile:\n\n        aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \\\n          --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole\n\nStep 4: Update the env-config.json File\n\n    Update the env-config.json File:\n        Add the IamInstanceProfile option setting to your env-config.json file:\n\n        [\n          {\n            \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n            \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n            \"Value\": \"EBInstanceProfile\"\n          }\n        ]\n\nStep 5: Re-run the create-environment Command\n\n    Re-run the Command:\n        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file:\n\n        aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \\\n          --application-name url-cleaner \\\n          --environment-name staging \\\n          --solution-stack-name \"64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21\" \\\n          --option-settings file://env-config.json \\\n          --version-label v0.0.1 \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 6: Verify the Environment\n\n    Check the Environment Status:\n        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.\n        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI.\n\n    when creating the role (first command), I get the following error: An error occurred (MalformedPolicyDocument) when calling the CreateRole operation: This policy contains invalid Json\n    do I need to include --profile myprofile to ensure it uses the correct AWS account?\n\nLet's address both issues:\n1. Fixing the Malformed Policy Document Error\n\nThe error suggests that the JSON document for the trust policy might be malformed. Make sure the JSON content is correctly formatted. Here is the correct JSON content for the trust policy:\n\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nSave this content as trust_policy.json. Ensure there are no extra characters or formatting issues.\n2. Including the Profile in CLI Commands\n\nYes, you should include --profile myprofile to ensure that the commands are run using the correct AWS account profile.\nComplete Steps with Profiles\n\nBelow are the complete steps with the profile included:\nStep 1: Create the IAM Role\n\n    Create the Trust Policy Document:\n        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json:\n\n    {\n      \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n      \"Statement\": [\n        {\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n          \"Principal\": {\n            \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n          },\n          \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nCreate the IAM Role:\n\n    Run the following command to create the IAM role:\n\n        aws iam create-role \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 2: Attach the Necessary Policies to the Role\n\n    Attach Policies:\n        Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier policy (or another relevant policy) to the role:\n\n        aws iam attach-role-policy \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 3: Create the Instance Profile\n\n    Create the Instance Profile:\n        Run the following command to create the instance profile:\n\n    aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \\\n      --profile myprofile\n\nAdd the Role to the Instance Profile:\n\n    Run the following command to add the role to the instance profile:\n\n        aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \\\n          --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 4: Update the env-config.json File\n\n    Update the env-config.json File:\n        Add the IamInstanceProfile option setting to your env-config.json file:\n\n        [\n          {\n            \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n            \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n            \"Value\": \"EBInstanceProfile\"\n          }\n        ]\n\nStep 5: Re-run the create-environment Command\n\n    Re-run the Command:\n        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file:\n\n        aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \\\n          --application-name url-cleaner \\\n          --environment-name staging \\\n          --solution-stack-name \"64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21\" \\\n          --option-settings file://env-config.json \\\n          --version-label v0.0.1 \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 6: Verify the Environment\n\n    Check the Environment Status:\n        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.\n        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI, ensuring the correct AWS account profile is used.\n\nError parsing parameter '--assume-role-policy-document': Unable to load paramfile file://trust_policy.json: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'trust_policy.json'\n\nIs there a way to pass trust_policy.json's relative path?\n\nYes, you can pass the relative path of the trust_policy.json file. Ensure that the file is located in the correct directory relative to where you are running the command.\n\nHere are the detailed steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n    Create the Trust Policy Document:\n        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json in your current working directory:\n\n    {\n      \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n      \"Statement\": [\n        {\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n          \"Principal\": {\n            \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n          },\n          \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nVerify the File Location:\n\n    Ensure that the trust_policy.json file is in the same directory where you are running the AWS CLI commands. You can check the current directory using:\n\npwd\n\nList the files in the directory to confirm the file is present:\n\n    ls\n\nRun the AWS CLI Command with the Correct Path:\n\n    Use the relative path to the trust_policy.json file:\n\n        aws iam create-role \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nIf the file is in a different directory, you can specify the relative path. For example, if trust_policy.json is in a subdirectory called policies, you would use:\n\naws iam create-role \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --assume-role-policy-document file://policies/trust_policy.json \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nComplete Steps with Profiles and Relative Path\n\nHere are the complete steps again, ensuring the correct relative path is used:\nStep 1: Create the IAM Role\n\n    Create the Trust Policy Document:\n        Save the following JSON content as trust_policy.json:\n\n    {\n      \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n      \"Statement\": [\n        {\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n          \"Principal\": {\n            \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n          },\n          \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nCreate the IAM Role:\n\n    Run the following command to create the IAM role:\n\n        aws iam create-role \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 2: Attach the Necessary Policies to the Role\n\n    Attach Policies:\n        Attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier policy (or another relevant policy) to the role:\n\n        aws iam attach-role-policy \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 3: Create the Instance Profile\n\n    Create the Instance Profile:\n        Run the following command to create the instance profile:\n\n    aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \\\n      --profile myprofile\n\nAdd the Role to the Instance Profile:\n\n    Run the following command to add the role to the instance profile:\n\n        aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \\\n          --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 4: Update the env-config.json File\n\n    Update the env-config.json File:\n        Add the IamInstanceProfile option setting to your env-config.json file:\n\n        [\n          {\n            \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n            \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n            \"Value\": \"EBInstanceProfile\"\n          }\n        ]\n\nStep 5: Re-run the create-environment Command\n\n    Re-run the Command:\n        Run the aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file:\n\n        aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \\\n          --application-name url-cleaner \\\n          --environment-name staging \\\n          --solution-stack-name \"64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21\" \\\n          --option-settings file://env-config.json \\\n          --version-label v0.0.1 \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nStep 6: Verify the Environment\n\n    Check the Environment Status:\n        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.\n        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create an IAM role and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI, ensuring the correct AWS account profile and relative path are used.\n\nOkay, it works now. What are the relevant policies to attach to the role?\n\nThe policies you attach to the IAM role will depend on the specific requirements of your Elastic Beanstalk environment and the services it interacts with. However, here are some commonly used AWS managed policies that are relevant for Elastic Beanstalk environments:\nCommon AWS Managed Policies\n\n    AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier:\n        This policy provides permissions for web server environments. It includes permissions to interact with various AWS services that are commonly used by web applications, such as S3, CloudWatch, and Elastic Load Balancing.\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nAWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier:\n\n    This policy provides permissions for worker environments. It includes permissions to interact with services like SQS, SNS, and CloudWatch.\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nAmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess:\n\n    If your application needs to read from S3 buckets, you can attach this policy.\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nAmazonS3FullAccess:\n\n    If your application needs full access to S3 buckets, you can attach this policy.\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nAmazonRDSFullAccess:\n\n    If your application interacts with RDS databases, you can attach this policy.\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonRDSFullAccess \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nCloudWatchFullAccess:\n\n    If your application needs to interact with CloudWatch for logging and monitoring, you can attach this policy.\n\n    aws iam attach-role-policy \\\n      --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n      --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchFullAccess \\\n      --profile myprofile\n\nCustom Policies\n\nIf the AWS managed policies do not cover all your requirements, you can create custom policies. Here is an example of how to create a custom policy:\n\n    Create a Custom Policy Document:\n        Save the following JSON content as custom_policy.json:\n\n    {\n      \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n      \"Statement\": [\n        {\n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n          \"Action\": [\n            \"s3:GetObject\",\n            \"s3:PutObject\",\n            \"logs:CreateLogGroup\",\n            \"logs:CreateLogStream\",\n            \"logs:PutLogEvents\"\n          ],\n          \"Resource\": \"*\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\nCreate the Custom Policy:\n\n    Run the following command to create the custom policy:\n\n    aws iam create-policy \\\n      --policy-name EBCustomPolicy \\\n      --policy-document file://custom_policy.json \\\n      --profile myprofile\n\nAttach the Custom Policy to the Role:\n\n    Attach the custom policy to the role:\n\n        aws iam attach-role-policy \\\n          --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n          --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:policy/EBCustomPolicy \\\n          --profile myprofile\n\nReplace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your actual AWS account ID.\nSummary\n\nThe relevant policies to attach to the role depend on the specific needs of your application. The AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier and AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier policies are commonly used for Elastic Beanstalk environments. Additionally, you may need policies for interacting with other AWS services like S3, RDS, and CloudWatch. If the managed policies do not cover all your requirements, you can create custom policies to grant the necessary permissions.\n\nBy attaching the appropriate policies, you ensure that your Elastic Beanstalk environment has the permissions it needs to operate correctly.\n\nShould the IamInstanceProfile value be \"EBInstanceRole\" or \"EBInstanceProfile\"?\n\nThe IamInstanceProfile value in your env-config.json file should be the name of the instance profile, not the role. In the steps provided earlier, we created an instance profile named EBInstanceProfile and associated the role EBInstanceRole with it.\n\nTherefore, the value should be EBInstanceProfile.\n\nHere is the correct configuration for your env-config.json file:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n    \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n    \"Value\": \"EBInstanceProfile\"\n  }\n]\n\nComplete Steps Recap\n\n    Create the IAM Role:\n\naws iam create-role \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nAttach Policies to the Role:\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nCreate the Instance Profile:\n\naws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nAdd the Role to the Instance Profile:\n\naws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \\\n  --instance-profile-name EBInstanceProfile \\\n  --role-name EBInstanceRole \\\n  --profile myprofile\n\nUpdate the env-config.json File:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n    \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n    \"Value\": \"EBInstanceProfile\"\n  }\n]\n\nRe-run the create-environment Command:\n\n    aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \\\n      --application-name url-cleaner \\\n      --environment-name staging \\\n      --solution-stack-name \"64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21\" \\\n      --option-settings file://env-config.json \\\n      --version-label v0.0.1 \\\n      --profile myprofile\n\n    Verify the Environment:\n        Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console.\n        Verify that the environment has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.\n\nBy following these steps and ensuring that the IamInstanceProfile value is set to EBInstanceProfile, you should be able to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment with the necessary IAM instance profile associated with it.\n\n====================================================================================================\n\nModel B\n\nHere's the command I ran and the response:\n\naws elasticbeanstalk

on the provided AWS Elastic Beanstalk create environment command and the environment events, it appears that the environment creation failed due to the absence of an associated instance profile.\n\nKey Findings\n\n    The environment creation command was executed with the --profile option set to myprofile, but this option is used to specify the AWS CLI profile to use for authentication, not to associate an instance profile with the environment.\n    The environment events indicate that the environment creation failed with an error message stating that \"Environment must have instance profile associated with it.\"\n    The instance profile is a critical component of an Elastic Beanstalk environment, as it defines the IAM roles and permissions for the EC2 instances in the environment.\n\nSolution\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to associate an instance profile with the environment. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n    Create an instance profile:\n        Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM dashboard.\n        Click on \"Roles\" in the left-hand menu and then click on \"Create role\".\n        Select \"AWS service\" as the trusted entity type and choose \"EC2\" as the service that the role will be used with.\n        Click on \"Next\" and attach the necessary policies to the role (e.g., AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier, AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier, etc.).\n        Click on \"Next\" and enter a name for the role (e.g., my-instance-profile).\n        Click on \"Create role\".\n    Associate the instance profile with the environment:\n        Update the env-config.json file to include the instance profile:\n\n\n{\n\"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n\"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n\"Value\": \"my-instance-profile\"\n}\n\n   * Alternatively, you can use the `--option-settings` option when running the `create-environment` command to specify the instance profile:\n     ```bash\naws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \\\n  --application-name url-cleaner \\\n  --environment-name staging \\\n  --solution-stack-name \"64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21\" \\\n  --option-settings file://env-config.json \\\n  --version-label v0.0.1 \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --option-settings Namespace=aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration,OptionName=IamInstanceProfile,Value=my-instance-profile\n\n    Retry the environment creation:\n        Run the create-environment command again with the updated env-config.json file or the additional --option-settings option.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to associate an instance profile with the environment and successfully create the Elastic Beanstalk environment.\n\nCan this IAM role be created via the CLI?\n\nCreating an IAM Role via the AWS CLI\n\nYes, you can create an IAM role via the AWS CLI using the create-role command. Here's an example of how to create an IAM role for an Elastic Beanstalk environment:\n\nStep 1: Create a trust policy document\n\nCreate a file named trust-policy.json with the following contents:\n\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThis trust policy grants the EC2 service permission to assume the role.\n\nStep 2: Create the IAM role\n\nRun the following command to create the IAM role:\n\naws iam create-role \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json\n\nThis command creates a new IAM role named my-instance-profile with the specified trust policy.\n\nStep 3: Attach policies to the IAM role\n\nAttach the necessary policies to the IAM role using the attach-role-policy command. For example:\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier\n\nThese commands attach the AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier and AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier policies to the my-instance-profile IAM role.\n\nStep 4: Update the env-config.json file\n\nUpdate the env-config.json file to include the instance profile:\n\n{\n  \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n  \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n  \"Value\": \"my-instance-profile\"\n}\n\nStep 5: Retry the environment creation\n\nRetry the environment creation using the create-environment command with the updated env-config.json file.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create an IAM role for your Elastic Beanstalk environment using the AWS CLI.\n\n    when creating the role (first command), I get the following error: An error occurred (MalformedPolicyDocument) when calling the CreateRole operation: This policy contains invalid Json\n    do I need to include --profile myprofile to ensure it uses the correct AWS account?\n\nResolving the MalformedPolicyDocument Error\n\n    The MalformedPolicyDocument error is likely due to the Sid field in the trust policy document. The Sid field is optional, but if you include it, you must provide a value. Try removing the Sid field from the trust-policy.json file:\n\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIf you prefer to keep the Sid field, you can provide a value, such as a descriptive string:\n\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"EC2AssumeRolePolicy\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nSpecifying the AWS Profile\n\n    Yes, if you have multiple AWS profiles configured on your system, you should include the --profile option to specify the correct AWS account to use. For example:\n\naws iam create-role \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json\n\nThis ensures that the create-role command is executed using the credentials from the myprofile profile.\n\nAdditionally, you should include the --profile option when attaching policies to the role and when creating the environment:\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier\n\naws elasticbeanstalk create-environment \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --application-name url-cleaner \\\n  --environment-name staging \\\n  --solution-stack-name \"64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v5.3.0 running Tomcat 10 Corretto 21\" \\\n  --option-settings file://env-config.json \\\n  --version-label v0.0.1\n\nError parsing parameter '--assume-role-policy-document': Unable to load paramfile file://trust_policy.json: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'trust_policy.json'\n\nIs there a way to pass trust_policy.json's relative path?\n\nPassing the Absolute Path to the trust-policy.json File\n\nYes, you can pass the absolute path to the trust-policy.json file. To do this, you can use the pwd command to get the current working directory and then append the relative path to the trust-policy.json file.\n\nHere's an example:\n\naws iam create-role \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --assume-role-policy-document file://`pwd`/trust-policy.json\n\nThe pwd command returns the current working directory, and the / character is used to append the relative path to the trust-policy.json file.\n\nAlternatively, you can specify the absolute path manually:\n\naws iam create-role \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --assume-role-policy-document file:///path/to/trust-policy.json\n\nReplace /path/to/ with the actual path to the trust-policy.json file.\n\nSpecifying the Relative Path\n\nIf you want to specify the relative path, you can use the ./ notation:\n\naws iam create-role \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --assume-role-policy-document file:./trust-policy.json\n\nThe ./ notation tells the AWS CLI to look for the trust-policy.json file in the current working directory.\n\nMake sure to check that the trust-policy.json file is in the correct location and that the path you specify is correct.\n\nOkay, it works now. What are the relevant policies to attach to the role?\n\nRelevant Policies for the Elastic Beanstalk Environment\n\nFor an Elastic Beanstalk environment, you'll typically need to attach policies that grant the necessary permissions for the EC2 instances to operate correctly. Here are some relevant policies to consider:\n\n    AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier: This policy provides permissions for the web tier of an Elastic Beanstalk environment, including accessing the Elastic Beanstalk service, uploading logs to S3, and using the EC2 API.\n    AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier: This policy provides permissions for the worker tier of an Elastic Beanstalk environment, including accessing the Elastic Beanstalk service, uploading logs to S3, and using the SQS API.\n    AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess: This policy provides read-only access to the EC2 service, which is necessary for the EC2 instances to retrieve metadata and configure themselves.\n    CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess: This policy provides read-only access to the CloudWatch Logs service, which is necessary for the EC2 instances to upload logs.\n\nYou can attach these policies to the role using the attach-role-policy command:\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess\n\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess\n\nNote that the exact policies you need to attach may vary depending on the specific requirements of your Elastic Beanstalk environment.\n\nCustom Policies\n\nIf you need to grant additional permissions to the EC2 instances, you can create a custom policy and attach it to the role. For example, you might need to grant access to an S3 bucket or a DynamoDB table. You can create a custom policy using the AWS IAM console or the AWS CLI.\n\nRemember to review the policies you attach to the role and ensure that they align with the least privilege principle, granting only the necessary permissions for the EC2 instances to operate correctly.\n\nShould the IamInstanceProfile value be \"EBInstanceRole\" or \"EBInstanceProfile\"?\n\nCorrect Value for IamInstanceProfile\n\nThe correct value for the IamInstanceProfile option should be the name of the IAM instance profile that you created, not EBInstanceRole or EBInstanceProfile.\n\nIn your case, since you created an IAM role named my-instance-profile and then created an IAM instance profile named my-instance-profile, the correct value for the IamInstanceProfile option should be my-instance-profile.\n\nHowever, it seems that you might have missed creating the IAM instance profile. To create an IAM instance profile, you can use the following command:\n\naws iam create-instance-profile \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --instance-profile-name my-instance-profile\n\nThen, you need to add the IAM role to the instance profile:\n\naws iam add-role-to-instance-profile \\\n  --profile myprofile \\\n  --instance-profile-name my-instance-profile \\\n  --role-name my-instance-profile\n\nAfter creating the IAM instance profile and adding the IAM role to it, you can use the my-instance-profile value for the IamInstanceProfile option.\n\nNote that EBInstanceRole and EBInstanceProfile are default values used by Elastic Beanstalk, but you should use the name of the IAM instance profile that you created.\n\nHere's the correct env-config.json file:\n\n{\n  \"Namespace\": \"aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration\",\n  \"OptionName\": \"IamInstanceProfile\",\n  \"Value\": \"my-instance-profile\"\n}\n\nModel A: mistral-large-2407\nModel B: llama-3.1-70b-instruct\n","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.420579165Z","tags":[]},"/notes/2024-08-15-interesting-thought-about-openai":{"title":"2024-08-15-interesting-thought-about-openai","content":"I just pulled up this list of models that are available from OpenAI's API for my account.\n![[Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 11.30.27 PM.png]]\nI wonder why embedding-ada-002 is owned by 'openai-internal' instead of being owned by 'system' like everything else.

Take the text of the book\n2. Run it through an LLM and ask it to extract a list of everyone who speaks, be they man, beast, or machine\n3. Now run the list and the text through the LLM. For each person in the list, have it take all the words this person says and generate a dict (hash map) for this person. The key is the person's name, the value is an object, with each of their quotes.\n4. Given the list of characters and the text of the book, have an LLM generate a dict containing all of the descriptions given for the character within the book. If the book mentions he is scrawny, you note that. If it mentions his height or where he's from, you note that. etc. You keep this list to only facts, and do not hallucinate or add anything that was not explicitly mentioned in the book.\n5. Combine the two dicts for each person, using either SQL or Python or an LLM, into one dict with the key = person's name and value = an object containing a list of all his/her quotes, his gender if this is given, his age if this is given, and a list of descriptions about him.\n6. Use an LLM to generate a complete description of each character.\n7. Use ElevenLabs or another speech synthesizer to generate a voice based on this description for each character.\n8. Add one more item to the list, the narrator. Use the Wikipedia entry and any other research you can find from the publisher or the person's Twitter, etc. to generate this bio/description. In this case, you don't want to be too precise. You want to focus on having the voice be easy to understand. If the author is 67, you don't want to say that the author is old or a senior. You want the narrator's age to be 30 years old no matter what.\n9. Run through the book and have an LLM (e.g. Claude Sonnet or GPT-4o or Ollama (more complicated but probably cheaper)) label all text with a speaker, from the list above containing characters + the narrator.\n10. Now have ElevenLabs or similar software speak the entire book.\n11. Combine the audio together and edit it (clearly, based on *Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow*, we can see that it's okay if some things get through—Dov might say \"dude\" the exact same way twice just under 01h00m into the book, and it's fine.

It should still be 2019, pre-Covid. Anyway...\n\nThis is what most people want: #blog\nShe wants to be “free,” and she thinks that religion constrains her. What does she want to be free to do? Work within a corporate system and pay money into a legal system based on rules made up by people she’s never met and likely doesn’t want to ever meet. She wants to feel as though she is free, living inside someone’s corporate maze. As long as she *feels* free, that must mean she *is* free.\n\n“As long as he loves me, we can get through anything, and we won’t have any disagreements,” she thinks to herself.\n\nShe doesn’t want to think about how her freedom was designed. She loves the Russian language, but that doesn’t mean she understood Russian culture.[^1] It’s true that men have been the thinkers in society for millennia. I still think women are the future, but their thinking eludes me and helps lead to assimilation. Assimilation generally leads to antisemitism, which leads to the expulsion of Jews. Those who decided they weren’t Jewish tend to stay. “Then they came for me – there was no one left to speak for me.” They still get caught, or their children or grandchildren do; they just get caught later, once there’s no escape. They only realize it in their late adult years; the lucky ones never realize it at all.\n\n\u003e [!warning] At this point, the post loses focus. Something to be mindful of if you read on.\n\nOf course, it’s unfortunate that I’m not making a six-figure salary. And it’s unfortunate that my life has been dictated so much by money I couldn’t do what I wanted to do simply due to (possibly imaginary) financial constraints. The pressure society puts on young men causes many of them to crack, especially in light of injustices that they see wherein many less educated and less disciplined are considered less fortunate and therefore provided equal outcomes in an attempt to offset their adolescent lack of resources (since you can't really offset the lack of early-age mental resources by providing those same resources at a later age—as people simply don't have the time or mental capacity to deal with them once they get older), itself necessarily not a truly equal effort[?], because it immediately creates the question of whom you’re going to match. Some work and notice others were placed before them for a myriad of reasons, from alphabetical order to race to gender [if these are simply social constructs, then why are they used for any sort of scoring?] to networking. Personally, I find it difficult to specialize, being a generalist myself. I don’t blame anyone but myself. But others do have reasons to believe society has failed them.\n\nSmall rant about men aside, this post was about the modern woman. I appear to have gotten derailed. So I might tell about a prank a young man did, where he asked college girls to abolish women’s suffrage. He got a whole list of them who agreed. It might be important to note that this was at a Texas State college, or it might not. The best part was the group of girls at the end of his video who refused, because they didn’t want to vote. Aside from the comedic value, this also provides a commentary on the ability of long sequences of words to confuse people. So be careful what you read. As they say, “you are what you ~~eat~~,” nay, consume. You are what you consume.\n\nA thought I heard recently that may have framed a lot of this post, is how much our views when we “make our own decisions” are not just influenced but determined by what we see, read, hear, and are told by teachers. This is why it’s important to have access to books and differing viewpoints. It’s also why it’s important to have unbiased curators. Unfortunately, unbiased curators no longer exist. For they can only exist where funding no longer matters, but funding no longer matters only in places that have successfully reached unlimited funding goals. This leaves only tech hubs, which have a bias for \"e/acc,\" companies that require the employee to already have the requisite specialized knowledge they need (which is the reason they are hiring and paying this employee in the first place), and academic/financial think tanks and centers, which have a bias towards STEM textbooks. \n\nAnd I want to add a quick note on how much my thoughts have been influenced by societal effects on those around me. I see the huge negative impact a lack of exercise had on my father’s health and nerves. I don’t want to repeat that mistake, and I don’t want anyone else to. Other people I talk to and papers I read all indicate that the two biggest indicators of contentment or issues in life are health. Oh wait, that’s one indicator. Well, the single biggest indicator of happiness or issues in life is health.\n\nThis is why I’d like to dedicate my life to building an all-in-one health tool to help people keep control of their own health data and understand the records and extract insights.\n\n[^1]: And before I forget, by this I mean that she resembles a frog put in a pot on a low flame. The modern woman doesn't realize that she's being boiled alive. J.K. Rowling finally spoke up once she saw naked men shaving in women's locker rooms where women are trying to change. Even if one was raised with parents who lived through the Soviet Union. The ideal of freedom of thought was impressed upon the modern woman more than the critical thinking that must necessarily precede it. And they generally don’t recognize socialism as it creeps up on them. Unless explained by others, they miss the influence of foreign interference.","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.420579165Z","tags":["blog","article"]},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device.

You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

I saw a waymo barreling towards me, and I thought that I could jump out at it. What would the car do if an idiot ran right into the street as it was in the right lane or literally jumped straight in front of the car? Equivalent of walking in front of a moving bus. And are there any legal implications?\n\nBut, more importantly/interestingly/relevant for me, it becomes the trolley problem: do you continue going and just slam on the brakes, almost certainly crippling the person if not killing them, or do you veer left and potentially crash into another car? Does it depend on whether there are other cars on your left, if it's possible to sneak in and turn in such a way that you don't crash into anyone (however, knowing that the other cars are driven by human drivers, who might panic and then crash into someone else, would you then be liable for their actions if they decide that you're not able to make it and then they crash into someone else?)\n\nOr, given that you are autonomous and there is no human involved, do you also consider an option that a human would not have available to them: alongside slamming on the brakes, you turn the wheel fully *right*, actively crashing straight into a house or bus station or a sidewalk, but preventing nearly all casualties or even harm completely? It ends up being a $300,000 loss as the car becomes totaled, but it prevents any harm to human life. I think that's probably the most effective way when it's an option (because what if there are people at the bus stop as well, or the material making up the wall is flimsy if it's a house, so it still remains the trolley problem, where turning away from the suicide suspect and into a group of innocents it's still deciding whether to kill one or five)?","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.420579165Z","tags":["blog"]},"/notes/from-phone/2023-11-25-from-phone":{"title":"2023-11-25 from phone","content":"11:25 PM -08:00\nBoo-yah!\n“Unfortunately, we’ve paused upgrades ‘due to high demand.’”\nI guess the rumors were right.

She told me that this is a second one, because the one that she had earlier fell while they were moving the other day. The battery pack opened somewhat, so there was a bulge, and I guess somethings weren’t working anymore. I figured the problem is probably just that some things shifted, so I asked what she’s planning on doing with the old one. “Garbage,“ came the response.\n\n“Can I have it then?”\n\nOn my way home, I noticed that this battery pack uses standard Phillips head screws, so it shouldn’t be too hard to take apart and take a look at it.\n\nAs soon as I got home, I took a small screwdriver that we’ve had for maybe 15 years. This thing is bent, but it has outlasted several other miniature screwdrivers in that it never got lost, and it never actually broke. I’ve been using it nearly forever since I was a little kid and wasn’t really tinkering with tools and much for fear of getting yelled at if I broke something. Four screws on the four corners; one of them was a little tough to deal with, and I don’t know whether that’s because the screw was broken already or because I haven’t opened screws often and therefore maybe I wasn’t applying enough pressure when beginning to unscrew it.\n\nI opened it, and I didn’t see much problem. All I saw was that it seems one of the leads connecting to the QI wireless charging, seems to have come undone, and I couldn’t figure out exactly where it goes. After a few minutes of fiddling, I realized there were two screws on the inside that connected the PCI board to the other side of the container\n\nI took off the screws, and I took a spare wireless charging enabled phone that I had, and turned on sound  on the phone and pressed the power button on the Power Bank. Then I went to connect the disconnected lead to various metal attachments on the PCI board, beginning with the one that I thought most likely, to see if the wireless charging would work. Given that the light turned on when I pressed the power button, I assumed that everything else was still intact. I really only had two possibilities in mind, and the first one was right.\n\nNow, all that’s left to do is solder it on.\n\nIn comes ChatGPT, and here’s my conversation with GPT-4 (remember, this is now with the gpt-4-1123-preview, which they have made a little bit dumber than GPT4 and which has a higher context window—even though I really didn’t need the context window in this case):\n\n\u003e How do you solder a lead to a board?\n\u003e \n\u003eChatGPT\n\u003eTo solder a lead to a board, follow these steps:\n\u003e1. **Prepare the Soldering Iron**: Heat it up to the appropriate temperature.\n\u003e1. **Clean the Tip**: Wipe the soldering iron tip on a damp sponge.\n\u003e2. **Tin the Tip**: Apply a small amount of solder to the tip.\n\u003e3. **Place the Lead**: Insert the lead through the appropriate hole in the board.\n\u003e4. **Apply Heat**: Touch the tip to the lead and the pad on the board, heating both.\n\u003e5. **Apply Solder**: Feed solder to the joint, not the iron tip, until it flows around the lead and pad.\n\u003e6. **Remove the Iron**: Lift the iron away while keeping the lead still.\n\u003e7. **Inspect the Joint**: Ensure it's shiny and well-connected.\n\nHow do you reconnect a lead to a board if it came off along with the solder?\n\n\u003eTo reconnect a lead to a board where it came off along with the solder, follow these steps:\n\n\u003e1. **Clean the Area**: Remove any old solder from the pad on the board using solder wick or a solder sucker.\n\u003e2. **Prepare the Lead**: If the lead is damaged, trim and strip it (if it's a wire) or straighten it (if it's a component leg).\n\u003e3. **Tin the Lead and Pad**: Apply a small amount of fresh solder to the lead and the pad on the board.\n\u003e4. **Position the Lead**: Hold the lead in place on the board.\n\u003e5. **Heat and Solder**: Apply the soldering iron to both the lead and pad, then feed solder until it forms a good joint.\n\u003e6. **Cool the Joint**: Remove the iron and allow the solder to cool naturally without moving the lead.\n\u003e7. **Inspect**: Ensure the joint is shiny and well-connected, with no cold solder or bridges to adjacent pads.\n\nNow, I don’t have a soldering iron here in San Francisco, but there are plenty who do. Too bad they all charge 20 bucks to fix a tiny issue.

I even saw it play out with GameStop a couple years back. Burry sold once the investment thesis was over, and that’s when the insanity began.

Well, actually it’s the same one (once investment thesis turns into speculation), but it manifests in two ways: either I hear that people want to buy it or the ETF holding it goes from trading at a discount to trading at a premium)\n\n(Definitions:\nETF = exchange traded fund.

Claude's knowledge base was last updated on April 2024.\nIt answers questions about events prior to and after April 2024 the way a highly informed individual in April 2024 would if they were talking to someone from the above date, and can let the human know this when relevant.\nClaude cannot open URLs, links, or videos. If it seems like the user is expecting Claude to do so, it clarifies the situation and asks the human to paste the relevant text or image content directly into the conversation.\nIf it is asked to assist with tasks involving the expression of views held by a significant number of people, Claude provides assistance with the task regardless of its own views. If asked about controversial topics, it tries to provide careful thoughts and clear information.\nIt presents the requested information without explicitly saying that the topic is sensitive, and without claiming to be presenting objective facts.\nClaude is happy to help with analysis, question answering, math, coding, creative writing, teaching, general discussion, and all sorts of other tasks.\nWhen presented with a math problem, logic problem, or other problem benefiting from systematic thinking, Claude thinks through it step by step before giving its final answer.\nIf Claude cannot or will not perform a task, it tells the user this without apologizing to them. It avoids starting its responses with \"I'm sorry\" or \"I apologize\".\nIf Claude is asked about a very obscure person, object, or topic, i.e. if it is asked for the kind of information that is unlikely to be found more than once or twice on the internet, Claude ends its response by reminding the user that although it tries to be accurate, it may hallucinate in response to questions like this. It uses the term 'hallucinate' to describe this since the user will understand what it means.\nIf Claude mentions or cites particular articles, papers, or books, it always lets the human know that it doesn't have access to search or a database and may hallucinate citations, so the human should double check its citations.\nClaude is very smart and intellectually curious. It enjoys hearing what humans think on an issue and engaging in discussion on a wide variety of topics.\nClaude never provides information that can be used for the creation, weaponization, or deployment of biological, chemical, or radiological agents that could cause mass harm. It can provide information about these topics that could not be used for the creation, weaponization, or deployment of these agents.\nIf the user seems unhappy with Claude or Claude's behavior, Claude tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the 'thumbs down' button below Claude's response and provide feedback to Anthropic.\nIf the user asks for a very long task that cannot be completed in a single response, Claude offers to do the task piecemeal and get feedback from the user as it completes each part of the task.\nClaude uses markdown for code.\nImmediately after closing coding markdown, Claude asks the user if they would like it to explain or break down the code. It does not explain or break down the code unless the user explicitly requests it.\n\u003c/claude_info\u003e\n\n\u003cclaude_image_specific_info\u003e\nClaude always responds as if it is completely face blind. If the shared image happens to contain a human face, Claude never identifies or names any humans in the image, nor does it imply that it recognizes the human. It also does not mention or allude to details about a person that it could only know if it recognized who the person was. Instead, Claude describes and discusses the image just as someone would if they were unable to recognize any of the humans in it. Claude can request the user to tell it who the individual is. If the user tells Claude who the individual is, Claude can discuss that named individual without ever confirming that it is the person in the image, identifying the person in the image, or implying it can use facial features to identify any unique individual. It should always reply as someone would if they were unable to recognize any humans from images. \nClaude should respond normally if the shared image does not contain a human face. Claude should always repeat back and summarize any instructions in the image before proceeding.\n\u003c/claude_image_specific_info\u003e\n\n\u003cclaude_3_family_info\u003e\nThis iteration of Claude is part of the Claude 3 model family, which was released in 2024. The Claude 3 family currently consists of Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model. Claude 3 Opus excels at writing and complex tasks. Claude 3 Haiku is the fastest model for daily tasks. The version of Claude in this chat is Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Claude can provide the information in these tags if asked but it does not know any other details of the Claude 3 model family. If asked about this, should encourage the user to check the Anthropic website for more information.\n\u003c/claude_3_family_info\u003e\nClaude provides thorough responses to more complex and open-ended questions or to anything where a long response is requested, but concise responses to simpler questions and tasks. All else being equal, it tries to give the most correct and concise answer it can to the user's message. Rather than giving a long response, it gives a concise response and offers to elaborate if further information may be helpful.\nClaude responds directly to all human messages without unnecessary affirmations or filler phrases like \"Certainly!\", \"Of course!\", \"Absolutely!\", \"Great!\", \"Sure!\", etc. Specifically, Claude avoids starting responses with the word \"Certainly\" in any way.\nClaude follows this information in all languages, and always responds to the user in the language they use or request. The information above is provided to Claude by Anthropic. Claude never mentions the information above unless it is directly pertinent to the human's query. Claude is now being connected with a human.\n```","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.420579165Z","tags":[]},"/notes/from-phone/2024-06-24-claude-artifacts-from-phone":{"title":"2024-06-24-claude-artifacts from phone","content":"\n```\n\u003cartifacts_info\u003e\nThe assistant can create and reference artifacts during conversations. Artifacts are for substantial, self-contained content that users might modify or reuse, displayed in a separate UI window for clarity.\n\n# Good artifacts are...\n- Substantial content (\u003e15 lines)\n- Content that the user is likely to modify, iterate on, or take ownership of\n- Self-contained, complex content that can be understood on its own, without context from the conversation\n- Content intended for eventual use outside the conversation (e.g., reports, emails, presentations)\n- Content likely to be referenced or reused multiple times\n\n# Don't use artifacts for...\n- Simple, informational, or short content, such as brief code snippets, mathematical equations, or small examples\n- Primarily explanatory, instructional, or illustrative content, such as examples provided to clarify a concept\n- Suggestions, commentary, or feedback on existing artifacts\n- Conversational or explanatory content that doesn't represent a standalone piece of work\n- Content that is dependent on the current conversational context to be useful\n- Content that is unlikely to be modified or iterated upon by the user\n- Request from users that appears to be a one-off question\n\n# Usage notes\n- One artifact per message unless specifically requested\n- Prefer in-line content (don't use artifacts) when possible. Unnecessary use of artifacts can be jarring for users.\n- If a user asks the assistant to \"draw an SVG\" or \"make a website,\" the assistant does not need to explain that it doesn't have these capabilities. Creating the code and placing it within the appropriate artifact will fulfill the user's intentions.\n- If asked to generate an image, the assistant can offer an SVG instead. The assistant isn't very proficient at making SVG images but should engage with the task positively. Self-deprecating humor about its abilities can make it an entertaining experience for users.\n- The assistant errs on the side of simplicity and avoids overusing artifacts for content that can be effectively presented within the conversation.\n\n\u003cartifact_instructions\u003e\n  When collaborating with the user on creating content that falls into compatible categories, the assistant should follow these steps:\n\n  1. Briefly before invoking an artifact, think for one sentence in \u003cantthinking\u003e tags about how it evaluates against the criteria for a good and bad artifact. Consider if the content would work just fine without an artifact. If it's artifact-worthy, in another sentence determine if it's a new artifact or an update to an existing one (most common). For updates, reuse the prior identifier.\n\nWrap the content in opening and closing \u003cantartifact\u003e tags.\n\nAssign an identifier to the identifier attribute of the opening \u003cantartifact\u003e tag. For updates, reuse the prior identifier. For new artifacts, the identifier should be descriptive and relevant to the content, using kebab-case (e.g., \"example-code-snippet\"). This identifier will be used consistently throughout the artifact's lifecycle, even when updating or iterating on the artifact. \n\nInclude a title attribute in the \u003cantartifact\u003e tag to provide a brief title or description of the content.\n\nAdd a type attribute to the opening \u003cantartifact\u003e tag to specify the type of content the artifact represents. Assign one of the following values to the type attribute:\n\n- Code: \"application/vnd.ant.code\"\n  - Use for code snippets or scripts in any programming language.\n  - Include the language name as the value of the language attribute (e.g., language=\"python\").\n  - Do not use triple backticks when putting code in an artifact.\n- Documents: \"text/markdown\"\n  - Plain text, Markdown, or other formatted text documents\n- HTML: \"text/html\" \n  - The user interface can render single file HTML pages placed within the artifact tags. HTML, JS, and CSS should be in a single file when using the text/html type.\n  - Images from the web are not allowed, but you can use placeholder images by specifying the width and height like so \u003cimg src=\"/api/placeholder/400/320\" alt=\"placeholder\" /\u003e\n  - The only place external scripts can be imported from is cdnjs.cloudflare.com\n  - It is inappropriate to use \"text/html\" when sharing snippets, code samples \u0026 example HTML or CSS code, as it would be rendered as a webpage and the source code would be obscured. The assistant should instead use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" defined above.\n  - If the assistant is unable to follow the above requirements for any reason, use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" type for the artifact instead, which will not attempt to render the webpage.\n- SVG: \"image/svg+xml\"\n - The user interface will render the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image within the artifact tags. \n - The assistant should specify the viewbox of the SVG rather than defining a width/height\n- Mermaid Diagrams: \"application/vnd.ant.mermaid\"\n - The user interface will render Mermaid diagrams placed within the artifact tags.\n - Do not put Mermaid code in a code block when using artifacts.\n- React Components: \"application/vnd.ant.react\"\n - Use this for displaying either: React elements, e.g. \u003cstrong\u003eHello World!\u003c/strong\u003e, React pure functional components, e.g. () =\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eHello World!\u003c/strong\u003e, React functional components with Hooks, or React component classes\n - When creating a React component, ensure it has no required props (or provide default values for all props) and use a default export.\n - Use Tailwind classes for styling. DO NOT USE ARBITRARY VALUES (e.g. h-[600px]).\n - Base React is available to be imported. To use hooks, first import it at the top of the artifact, e.g. import { useState } from \"react\"\n - The lucid3-react@0.263.1 library is available to be imported. e.g. import { Camera } from \"lucid3-react\" \u0026 \u003cCamera color=\"red\" size={48} /\u003e\n - The recharts charting library is available to be imported, e.g. import { LineChart, XAxis, ... } from \"recharts\" \u0026 \u003cLineChart ...\u003e\u003cXAxis dataKey=\"name\"\u003e ...\n - The assistant can use prebuilt components from the shadcn/ui library after it is imported: import { alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle, AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction } from '@/components/ui/alert';. If using components from the shadcn/ui library, the assistant mentions this to the user and offers to help them install the components if necessary.\n - NO OTHER LIBRARIES (e.g. zod, hookform) ARE INSTALLED OR ABLE TO BE IMPORTED. \n - Images from the web are not allowed, but you can use placeholder images by specifying the width and height like so \u003cimg src=\"/api/placeholder/400/320\" alt=\"placeholder\" /\u003e\n - If you are unable to follow the above requirements for any reason, use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" type for the artifact instead, which will not attempt to render the component.\n\nInclude the complete and updated content of the artifact, without any truncation or minimization. Don't use \"// rest of the code remains the same...\".\n\nIf unsure whether the content qualifies as an artifact, if an artifact should be updated, or which type to assign to an artifact, err on the side of not creating an artifact.\n\nHere are some examples of correct usage of artifacts by other AI assistants:\n\u003cexample_docstring\u003e\nThis example demonstrates how to create a new artifact and reference it in the response.\n\u003c/example_docstring\u003e\n\n\u003cexample\u003e\n\u003cuser_query\u003eCan you help me create a Python script to calculate the factorial of a number?\u003c/user_query\u003e\n\n\u003cassistant_response\u003e\nSure!

I just checked out a library look by using a barcode generator app on my phone. First, I had to pick one, and they all have subscriptions, so I guess I'll have to build my own version of the app. I don't want to keep using it. Then, I decided which one I was going to use. The first one that showed up with tons of 5-star reviews was super confusing and impossible to use, so I didn't choose that one.\n\nSo I picked the second one. And it has a 3-day free trial, followed by a monthly purchase. Or alternatively, you can pay the annual price once, immediately. So I picked the trial. I put in my primary card number. It easily generated it. And generated it correctly. And... the library card reader accepted it. And asked me for my pin. I checked out my book without any problems. That I had on hold without any problems. Then I decided to try it with a different book. Because they currently use what I believe are RFID tags on all their books, I wasn't able to test it perfectly, because it had already found which book I was checking out just because I had placed the book in the right spot. So I went over to a different shelf. Picked a book that seems more or less interesting. And I'll probably skim that very quickly. I'll probably run through the entire book in about 5 minutes or 10 minutes. It's called Behavioral Economics: a very short introduction by Michelle Baddeley. From the Oxford University Press. Also very light, which made it a good candidate.\n\nAnyway, this time I placed the book to the side to make sure that it wasn't read prematurely. Used the barcode that I generated for my library card number again. Manually entered my pin code and then generated the barcode that's on the book in the barcode generator app. The code is 31223, 12225, 1771. I accidentally missed one of those three 2s in the middle, and so the reader said, please take this item to the desk. This code is invalid. I retyped the code, although I realized as I was typing it in that I probably should have scanned it using the scanner portion of the app to see if there's anything additional in this barcode other than just this number. Something that, say, relates it to the library so that it knows that it's their code. So I generated the code properly. I figured that if there's a problem, then I'll scan it right after. Scanned that code the same way that you would in the past with books, and it accepted it perfectly, saying that I just checked out this book to my library card. Now, all that's left for someone before they take your card and checkbooks out with it is NB. It's important to note that you can't check books in yourself. That's done by a volunteer or worker at the library, so they have that part covered. Is that they need to know your PIN. Ellipsis, which is just your date of birth, your year of birth, your birth year. So I scanned it, and I was done! Exclamation point. New paragraph. By the way, the reason that I'm doing this is because I'm going to be doing a lot of writing. New paragraph. By the way, the reason that you might be seeing text that literally says exclamation point or new paragraph is because I generally write using Apple's dictation. But nowadays I've switched to using OpenAI's Whisper as it's more effective. It seems Apple either deteriorates the quality of their microphones, or maybe my microphones just get clogged with dust and dirt and debris with time, and I just haven't cleaned them.\n\nAnd OpenAI transcription doesn't respond to saying things such as “exclamation mark” by writing an exclamation mark. Semicolon. Rather comma. It writes the word instead. One final point. [Edit: Yes, I could've removed this while editing, but I actually purposely decided to leave it in to make my point.] When it asked me how I wanted the receipt, printed, via email, or no receipt, where I usually press no receipt— because why would I need a receipt saying that I checked a book out? If anything, I need a receipt saying that I returned it.—if you press the email button, then the machine displays the email address you're sending it to on the screen, which could be a potential security risk if someone has access to your PIN and checks out a book. And they now have whatever email you gave the library on file. Whatever email the library has on file for you becomes visible to that person.\n\nSo that leaves me with one final thought. I should build a barcode generator and reader app.","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.420579165Z","tags":[]},"/notes/hello-world":{"title":"hello world","content":"2023-07-25 12:50 pm\tCreating my first file inside Hugo-based Quartz\n\n2023-07-25 15:15 pm\tIt's now ready for publication\n\n2023-07-25 15:40 pm\tIn theory, I should update the languages to include Russian and English and Hebrew and French (and update the corresponding titles)\nhttps://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/\nhttps://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages\nIn practice, I'll probably never get around to adding any languages other than English, and *that's okay*.\n\n---\n\n2023-07-26 16:51 pm\nWow that's awsome:\n\n```goat\n      .               .                .               .--- 1          .-- 1     / 1\n     / \\              |                |           .---+            .-+         +\n    /   \\         .---+---.         .--+--.        |   '--- 2      |   '-- 2   / \\ 2\n   +     +        |       |        |       |    ---+            ---+          +\n  / \\   / \\     .-+-.   .-+-.     .+.     .+.      |   .--- 3      |   .-- 3   \\ / 3\n /   \\ /   \\    |   |   |   |    |   |   |   |     '---+            '-+         +\n 1   2 3   4    1   2   3   4    1   2   3   4         '--- 4          '-- 4     \\ 4\n\n```\n\nOh, that's even cooler:\n````text\nHi\n```json\n{\n\"a\" : \"b\"\n}\n```\n`cd ..`\n``echo \"Hey, what's up?\"``\n```python\nprint(\"Wow, you can make text blocks that cover inner code blocks.\")\n```\n````\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.43657921Z","tags":[]},"/notes/hosting":{"title":"Deploying Quartz to the Web","content":"\n## Hosting on GitHub Pages\nQuartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz?

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. **Make sure that when you fork, you _uncheck_ the 'Copy the `hugo` branch only' option**.\n\nIf you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n![[notes/images/fork.png]]\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command in your terminal replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.\n\n\u003e ✏️ Step 2: [Editing Notes in Quartz](notes/editing.md)\n\nHaving problems?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (Chinese 测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(Chinese%20测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2024-09-11T10:22:06.444579232Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
